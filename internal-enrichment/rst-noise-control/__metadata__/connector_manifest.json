  "description": "The RST Noise Control Connector allows OpenCTI to check if observables and indicators are benign or potentially noisy and not worth detecting. This connector performs a check of IP, Domain, URL, Hash values via RST Cloud API. This enhances the capability of OpenCTI by ensuring that well-known, popular, or benign values will not trigger thousands of FP detections or prevent actions in the connected security tools (RST Noise Control).",
