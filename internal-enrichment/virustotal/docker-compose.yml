      ##### WAIT_FOR_ARTIFACT_ANALYSIS_COMPLETION DETAILS ##### VirusTotal (VT) analysis of a new file can take tens of minutes to process dependent on size and priority in the VT analysis queue. Since this connector is a blocking process, it will attempt to wait a maximum of 25 minutes for analysis of the artifact to finish before enriching it with VT data. This delay will push all other calls being sent to VT into this connector's queue until the analysis is complete. If your VT connector is set to automatic enrichment above (CONNECTOR_AUTO=true) and you expect it to be making requests to the VT API frequently, it is suggested you:
      # 1) Disable the delaying block by changing the below VIRUSTOTAL_FILE_WAIT_FOR_ARTIFACT_ANALYSIS_COMPLETION to false. This will upload the artifact but will very likely require manually rerunning enrichment at a later time since the artifact is not analyzed immediately.
      # 2) Change the number of replicas of this connector in the docker-compose yaml file (deploy->replicas) so that as one VT connector waits for analysis to finish, another one can concurrently fetch results from the VT API.
      - VIRUSTOTAL_FILE_WAIT_FOR_ARTIFACT_ANALYSIS_COMPLETION=true # If upload unseen artifacts is enabled, have the connector wait for analysis completion and enrichment (within 25 minute timeout)
