## Introduction
Silent Push takes a unique approach to identifying developing cyber threats by creating Indicators of Future Attacks (IOFA) that are more useful, and more valuable than industry-standard IOCs.

We apply unique behavioral fingerprints to attacker activity and search across our proprietary DNS database – containing the most complete, accurate, and timely view of global internet-facing infrastructure anywhere in the world – to reveal adversary infrastructure and campaigns prior to launch.

***We know first!***
## Installation

### Requirements

- OpenCTI Platform >= 6.4.2

## Configuration variables

There are a number of configuration options, which are set either in `docker-compose.yml` (for Docker) or
in `config.yml` (for manual deployment).

### OpenCTI environment variables

Below are the parameters you'll need to set for OpenCTI:

| Parameter     | config.yml | Docker environment variable | Mandatory | Description                                          |

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

Before building the Docker container, you need to set the version of pycti in `requirements.txt` equal to whatever
version of OpenCTI you're running. Example, `pycti==5.12.20`. If you don't, it will take the latest version, but
sometimes the OpenCTI SDK fails to initialize.

Build a Docker Image using the provided `Dockerfile`.

Example:

```shell
# Replace the IMAGE NAME with the appropriate value
docker build . -t [IMAGE NAME]:latest
```

Make sure to replace the environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` with the appropriate configurations for your
environment. Then, start the docker container with the provided docker-compose.yml

```shell
docker compose up -d
# -d for detached
```

### Manual Deployment

Create a file `config.yml` based on the provided `config.yml.sample`.

Replace the configuration variables (especially the "**ChangeMe**" variables) with the appropriate configurations for
you environment.

Install the required python dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment):

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, start the connector from recorded-future/src:

```shell
python3 main.py
```

## Usage

After Installation, the connector should require minimal interaction to use, and should update automatically at a regular interval specified in your `docker-compose.yml` or `config.yml` in `duration_period`.

However, if you would like to force an immediate download of a new batch of entities, navigate to:

`Data management` -> `Ingestion` -> `Connectors` in the OpenCTI platform.

Find the connector, and click on the refresh button to reset the connector's state and force a new
download of data by re-running the connector.

## Behavior

This connector enriches Domains, IPv4, IPv6 and URLs observables.
Also enriches indicators containing those types of observables.


## Debugging

The connector can be debugged by setting the appropiate log level.
Note that logging messages can be added using `self.helper.connector_logger,{LOG_LEVEL}("Sample message")`, i.
e., `self.helper.connector_logger.error("An error message")`.

<!-- Any additional information to help future users debug and report detailed issues concerning this connector -->
