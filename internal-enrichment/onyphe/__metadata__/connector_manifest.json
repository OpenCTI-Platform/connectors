  "description": "The ONYPHE enrichment connector is designed to leverage the Ctiscan category of data to enrich observables, providing detailed Internet scan data\n and mapping for open ports, protocols, banners and relationships — including ASNs, organizations, certificates,\n DNS domains, technologies, ports, countries and analytical pivots such as Ja4s.\n In addition the Indicators can be enriched using the 'onyphe' pattern to run threat-hunting queries within the OpenCTI platform and import matching observables.",
