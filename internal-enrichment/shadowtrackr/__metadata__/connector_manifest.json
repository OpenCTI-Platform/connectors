  "description": "This internal enrichment connector lowers the score for IP addresses that arefalse positives, and changes the valid until date for sourcesthat are known to change function regularly, like CDNs, Clouds and VPNs.\nIf a newly ingested IP address is a CDN, Cloud or VPN it might still be a valid,ongoing attack that you'll want to detect or block. But chances are very highthat the same IP is used for something different, legitimate purpose the nextday. For this reason, this connector limits the valid to period instead oflowering the score. Notice that this check is done in context, together withthe information on the false positive estimate: a GMail server will be detectedas a cloud server, but gets a lowered score immediately. You don't want to blockGMail just because you got one spammy email.\nThe score reduction is based on the false positive estimate produced by theShadowTrackr API. Likewise, the CDN, Cloud and VPN information comes fromthe ShadowTrackr API. You'll need an API key to access the API.\nThe connector works for the following OpenCTI observable types:",
