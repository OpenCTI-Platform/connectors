The following repository is used to store the OpenCTI connectors for the platform integration with other tools and applications. To know how to enable connectors on OpenCTI, please read the [dedicated documentation](https://www.notion.so/luatix/Connectors-4586c588462d4a1fb5e661f2d9837db8).

## Connectors list and statuses

This repository is used to host connectors that are supported by the core development team of OpenCTI. Nevertheless, the community is also developping a lot of connectors, third-parties modules directly linked to OpenCTI. You can find the list of all available connectors and plugins in the [OpenCTI ecosystem dedicated space](https://www.notion.so/luatix/OpenCTI-Ecosystem-868329e9fb734fca89692b2ed6087e76).

## Contributing

If you want to make your connector available to the community, **please create a Pull Request on this repository**, then we will integrate it to the CI and in the [OpenCTI ecosystem](https://www.notion.so/luatix/OpenCTI-Ecosystem-868329e9fb734fca89692b2ed6087e76).
