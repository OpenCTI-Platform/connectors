The following repository is used to store the OpenCTI connectors for the platform integration with other tools and
applications. To know how to enable connectors on OpenCTI, please read
the [dedicated documentation](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/deployment/connectors).

## Connectors list and statuses

This repository is used to host connectors that are supported by the core development team of OpenCTI. Nevertheless, the
community is also developing a lot of connectors, third-parties modules directly linked to OpenCTI. You can find the
list of all available connectors and plugins in
the [OpenCTI Integrations Library](https://hub.filigran.io/cybersecurity-solutions/open-cti-integrations).

## Contributing

**Contributions are welcome and appreciated!**

If you want to help use improve or develop a new connector, please check out our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Once reviewed, we will integrate your connector into the CI and add it to the [OpenCTI Integrations Library](https://hub.filigran.io/cybersecurity-solutions/open-cti-integrations).

## License

**Unless specified otherwise**, connectors are released under
the [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/connectors/blob/master/LICENSE). If a connector is released by its
author under a different license, the subfolder corresponding to it will contain a *LICENSE* file.
