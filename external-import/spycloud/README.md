## Introduction

This connector allows organizations to feed OpenCTI using **Spycloud** knowledge.

Spycloud monitors and tracks compromised data, such as login credentials and personal information, across the web and other sources.
This connector imports such data, aka _breach records_, from Spycloud into OpenCTI as incidents and observables.

[Documentation about Spycloud API](https://spycloud-external.readme.io/sc-enterprise-api/docs/getting-started) is available on their platform.

## Installation

### Requirements

- OpenCTI Platform >= 6.5.X

## Configuration variables

There are a number of configuration options, which are set either in `docker-compose.yml` (for Docker) or
in `config.yml` (for manual deployment).

### OpenCTI environment variables

Below are the parameters you'll need to set for OpenCTI.  
**We assume that all environment variables' values are strings (e.g. stringified numbers, dates in ISO format, comma-separated lists, ...)**

Please find further details about Spycloud filters in their [API documentation](https://spycloud-external.readme.io/sc-enterprise-api/reference/data-watchlist)

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

Before building the Docker container, you need to set the version of pycti in `requirements.txt` equal to whatever
version of OpenCTI you're running. Example, `pycti==5.12.20`. If you don't, it will take the latest version, but
sometimes the OpenCTI SDK fails to initialize.

Build a Docker Image using the provided `Dockerfile`.

Example:

```shell
# Replace the IMAGE NAME with the appropriate value
docker build . -t [IMAGE NAME]:latest
```

Make sure to replace the environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` with the appropriate configurations for your
environment. Then, start the docker container with the provided docker-compose.yml

```shell
docker compose up -d
# -d for detached
```

### Manual Deployment

Create a file `config.yml` based on the provided `config.yml.sample`.

Replace the configuration variables (especially the "**ChangeMe**" variables) with the appropriate configurations for
you environment.

Install the required python dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment):

```shell
pip install .
```

Then, start the connector from recorded-future/src:

```shell
python main.py
```

## Usage

After Installation, the connector should require minimal interaction to use, and should update automatically at a
regular interval specified in your `docker-compose.yml` or `config.yml` in `duration_period`.

However, if you would like to force an immediate download of a new batch of entities, navigate to:

`Data management` -> `Ingestion` -> `Connectors` in the OpenCTI platform.

Find the connector, and click on the refresh button to reset the connector's state and force a new
download of data by re-running the connector.

## Behavior

<!--
Describe how the connector functions:
* What data is ingested, updated, or modified
* Important considerations for users when utilizing this connector
* Additional relevant details
-->

### General

This connector leverages OpenCTI connector _scheduler_, so it imports Spycloud breach records and create corresponding incidents and their related observables in OpenCTI at a defined periodicity.  
General documentation about connectors and the scheduler can be found on [Filigran's official doc](https://filigran.io/auto-backpressue-control-octi-connectors/#h-purpose-of-the-scheduler).

### Authentication

In order to authenticate the connector and access Spycloud API, an account with an API key must be set on their platform _and_ the IP address of the running connector must be whitelisted. More information is available in [Spycloud documentation](https://spycloud-external.readme.io/sc-enterprise-api/docs/getting-started#authentication).

### Data

The graph below describes all the different entities that can be created and/or updated by the connector in OpenCTI from
Spycloud's breach records.

| As each breach record can contain a lot of heterogeneous information, all fields are gathered into incident's description as a markdown table.
| These fields are saved as they are returned by Spycloud API.

graph LR
    subgraph Spycloud
        direction TB
        SpycloudBreachCatalog[BreachCatalog]
        SpycloudBreachRecord[BreachRecord]
    end

    subgraph OpenCTI
        direction TB

            direction TB
            OpenCTIIncident[Incident]
            OpenCTIObservable[Observable]
        end
    end

%% BreachCatalog includes BreachRecord
    SpycloudBreachCatalog -.->|has many| SpycloudBreachRecord
%% BreachRecord generates Incident
    SpycloudBreachRecord ==>|looping over found records| OpenCTIIncident & OpenCTIObservable
%% Observables are related-to Incident
    OpenCTIObservable -.->|related-to| OpenCTIIncident

```

## Debugging

The connector can be debugged by setting the appropiate log level.
Note that logging messages can be added using `self.helper.connector_logger,{LOG_LEVEL}("Sample message")`, i.
e., `self.helper.connector_logger.error("An error message")`.

### Known issues

- 403 - Unauthorized:  
   Spycloud requires client to authenticate with an API key, but also to whitelist the IP addresses accessing their services.  
   If this issue occurs, please double-check whitelisted IP addresses on Spycloud platform.

- 504 - Gateway Timeout:  
   Timeouts can occur using some combination of filters (e.g. `severity_levels = '5,20'` resulted in many timeouts during connector's development - it's depending on Spycloud data).  
   To mitigate timeout issues, a retry strategy has been implemented though it rarely solves the issue. Please choose wisely the combination of filters used.  
   If the issue still occurs, and/or a specific combination of filters is required, please reach out to Spycloud support for further help.

Some [other limitations](https://spycloud-external.readme.io/sc-enterprise-api/docs/getting-started#limitations) are documented by Spycloud on their platform.
