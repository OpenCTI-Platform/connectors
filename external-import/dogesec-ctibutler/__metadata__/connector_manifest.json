  "description": "The OpenCTI CTI Butler Connector enables organizations to import and maintain authoritative cyber threat intelligence knowledgebases directly within OpenCTI. Powered by CTI Butler, the connector provides automated access to widely used frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK (Enterprise, Mobile, and ICS), CAPEC, DISARM, ATLAS, as well as location and sector datasets—delivered as native STIX 2.1 objects with preserved structure and relationships.\n\nBy synchronizing these knowledge bases into OpenCTI, the connector eliminates the need to manage multiple individual framework connectors and ensures consistent, up-to-date reference intelligence across investigations, detections, and threat modeling workflows.",
  "short_description": "The OpenCTI CTI Butler Connector syncs intelligence from CTI Butler's knowledge bases to OpenCTI, enabling automated import of standardized threat intelligence frameworks.",
