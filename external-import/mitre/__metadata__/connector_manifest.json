  "description": "MITRE ATT&CK is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community. The integration of MITRE ATT&CK with OpenCTI allows for the ingestion of data from MITRE datasets, facilitating the pre-population of your OpenCTI instance. This includes importing information on tools, malware, campaigns, intrusion sets, attack patterns, courses of action, alongside MITRE-specific frameworks such as x-mitre-matrix, x-mitre-tactic, x-mitre-collection, x-mitre-data-source, and x-mitre-data-component. The connector supports the ingestion of data from MITRE Enterprise, MITRE Mobile, and MITRE ICS matrices.",
