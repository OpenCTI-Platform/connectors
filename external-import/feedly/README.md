# OpenCTI Feedly Connector

The OpenCTI Feedly connector allows you to import data from Feedly boards and folders. The connector leverages the Feedly API to retrieve the latest articles, and ingest them in OpenCTI with the relevant entities, indicators, detection rules, and relationships between the entities mentioned.

**Disclaimer** You will need the Feedly for Threat Intelligence package to enable this integration. You can learn more about our product here: https://feedly.com/i/landing/threatIntelligence
