# OpenCTI ANY.RUN feed connector

Import TI feed from ANY.RUN Interactive Online Malware Sandbox

## Installation

The OpenCTI ANY.RUN TI Feed connector is a standalone Python process that must have access to the OpenCTI platform and the RabbitMQ. RabbitMQ credentials and connection parameters are provided by the API directly, as configured in the platform settings.

Enabling this connector could be done by launching the Python process directly after providing the correct configuration in the config.yml file or within a Docker with the image anyrun/opencti-connector-anyrun-feed:latest. We provide an example of docker-compose.yml file that could be used independently or integrated to the global docker-compose.yml file of OpenCTI.

If you are using it independently, remember that the connector will try to connect to the RabbitMQ on the port configured in the OpenCTI platform.

### Requirements

- OpenCTI Platform >= 5.12.32
- ANY.RUN TI Feed subscription

### Configuration


The connector can be configured with the following variables:
