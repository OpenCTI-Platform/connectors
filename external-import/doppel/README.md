# OpenCTI Doppel Connector

This connector fetches alerts from the Doppel API and imports them into OpenCTI as.

## Installation

### Requirements

- OpenCTI Platform version >= 6.x
- Access to a **Doppel tenant** (API key and API URL)


## ðŸ”§ Configuration

The connector accepts config via:

- `docker-compose.yml` (Docker mode)
- `config.yml` (manual mode)

ðŸ’¡ Docker **env vars override** values in `config.yml`.


## Configuration variables

There are a number of configuration options, which are set either in `docker-compose.yml` (for Docker) or
in `config.yml` (for manual deployment).

### ðŸ”§ Configuration Parameters

These environment variables can be set via `config.yml` or in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Deployment

### Docker Deployment

Before building the Docker container, you need to set the version of pycti in `requirements.txt` equal to whatever
version of OpenCTI you're running. Example, `pycti==6.8.5`. If you don't, it will take the latest version, but
sometimes the OpenCTI SDK fails to initialize.

Build a Docker Image using the provided `Dockerfile`.

Example:

```shell
# Replace the IMAGE NAME with the appropriate value
docker build . -t [IMAGE NAME]:latest
```

Make sure to replace the environment variables in the main OpenCTI `docker-compose.yml` file with the appropriate configurations for your environment.
Then, start the container using that updated docker-compose.yml.
 

## Additional note
Although the Doppel connector folder contains its own `docker-compose.yml`, itâ€™s not used directly. Instead, the connector should be integrated into the main OpenCTI `docker-compose.yml` alongside the other services.

```shell
docker compose up -d
# -d for detached
```

### Manual Deployment

Create a file `config.yml` based on the provided `config.yml.sample`.

Replace the configuration variables (especially the "**ChangeMe**" variables) with the appropriate configurations for
you environment.

Install the required python dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment):

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, start the connector from recorded-future/src:

```shell
python3 main.py
```

## Additional note
If you are using it independently, remember that the connector will try to connect to the RabbitMQ on the port configured in the OpenCTI platform.

## Usage

After Installation, the connector should require minimal interaction to use, and should update automatically at a regular interval specified in your `docker-compose.yml` or `config.yml` in `polling_interval`.

However, if you would like to force an immediate download of a new batch of entities, navigate to:

`Data management` -> `Ingestion` -> `Connectors` in the OpenCTI platform.

Find the connector, and click on the refresh button to reset the connector's state and force a new
download of data by re-running the connector.

## Behavior


## Debugging

The connector can be debugged by setting the appropiate log level.
