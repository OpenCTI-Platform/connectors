# OpenCTI CRITs Connector

This connector is intended to provide a mechanism for synchronizing data from a CRITs CTI database instance
([https://crits.github.io](https://crits.github.io/)) into OpenCTI. The primary use case for this is to help
ease the migration from CRITs (a largely unmaintained platform, as of 2022) to OpenCTI. Inspiration from the
MISP connector, as well as some of the other connectors.

The CRITs project has some documentation on their Authenticated API available here:
* [https://github.com/crits/crits/wiki/Authenticated-API](https://github.com/crits/crits/wiki/Authenticated-API)

## Installation

Very few. The CRITs API calls will all be performed via the HTTP(S) REST API, which only needs the Python
requests library to function.

### Requirements

- OpenCTI Platform >= 5.3.15
- CRITs instance with API enabled
- CRITs username and API key for user authenticating for the sync

### Behavior ###

This connector is intended to help migrate data from a CRITs CTI database into OpenCTI, on a regular basis. It
is not designed to update CRITs with data from OpenCTI. The connector will, the first time it is run, import all
of the compatible data in the target CRITs database. Then, on subsequent runs, it will only import when things
have changed since the last run.

Each run, the connector first starts by looking for new Events to import, and imports them with their first-degree
object relationships as contents of the report. The connector will then look for CRITs objects that are related, and
both contained in the same Event, and it will upload a STIX relationship capturing this relationship into the
report as well. The campaign associated with the Event, either by a first-degree relationship, or use of the
"campaign" field on the report, will also be uploaded as a content. The connector will ignore the "campaign" field
on other non-Event object types. In its final phase, the connector will scan for all objects and relationships that
aren't related to an Event, and will upload those without an analysis report relationship into OpenCTI.

Campaigns will be auto-created (defaulting to use the IntrusionSet type, unless specified otherwise), and Organization
entities for each encountered Source will also be auto-created. The source.*.instances.*.reference id's will
all be imported as external references, with additional references created to point back at CRITs. Where they are
identified as well-formed URLs, they'll be stored as such, otherwise they'll be imported as UIDs.

There are a handful of datatypes that could not be imported, due to CRITs itself not exposing their contents via
the (never completed) REST API:
PCAP, Certificate, Screenshot

Similarly, original raw email content isn't capable of being reconstructed from the CRITs API. However, the most
significant metadata, headers, and portions of multipart contents are capable of being imported.

### Debugging ###

The connector logs useful statistics and debbuging data to the console at run-time
