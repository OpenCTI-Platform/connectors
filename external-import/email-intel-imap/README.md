# üì¨ Email Intel IMAP Connector

The **Email Intel IMAP Connector** enables the ingestion of cyber threat intelligence reports received via email into
the OpenCTI platform using the IMAP protocol. This connector allows organizations to automate the collection of
intelligence shared through email by regularly polling a mailbox and transforming each message into an OpenCTI report.

## üß© Introduction

This connector is designed to connect to an IMAP-compatible email inbox, extract email content and attachments, and
convert the data into structured CTI reports within OpenCTI. The connector is suitable for any threat intel flow that
relies on email as a delivery method and is compatible with standard IMAP servers.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- OpenCTI Platform >= 6.x
- IMAP-compatible mailbox

---

## üöÄ Deployment

### Docker Deployment

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build . -t opencti/connector-email-intel-imap:latest
```

2. Run using Docker Compose:

Copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env` and set the required environment variables.

```bash
docker compose up -d
# -d for detached mode
```

### Manual Deployment

1. Create and activate the virtual environment:

```bash
  python3.12 -m venv venv --prompt $(basename $PWD)
  source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

3 types of dependencies depending on your needs:

- Minimal requirements

```bash
  pip install -r src/requirements.txt 
```

- Tests + minimal requirements

```bash
  pip install -r tests/test-requirements.txt
```

- Development + tests + minimal requirements

```bash
  pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

3. Set up the configuration:

3 options:

- Create a `.env` file based on `.env.sample` and set the required environment variables.
- Create a `config.yml` file based on `config.yml.sample` and set the required parameters.
- Set the required environment variables directly in your shell.

4. Run the connector:

```bash
python3 src/main.py
```

### Dev tools

1. pylint

```bash
  pylint .
```

2. mypy

```bash
  mypy .
```

## üìå Usage

After deployment, the connector:

- Polls the configured mailbox at the interval defined in `CONNECTOR_DURATION_PERIOD`
- On first run, fetches emails received within the period defined by `RELATIVE_IMPORT_START_DATE`
- Each fetched email is transformed into an OpenCTI report:
    - `report_name`: Email subject
        - If the subject is empty, a default name is generated as follow `<no subject> from <sender@email.com>` where
          `<sender@email.com>` is the email address of the sender.
    - `report_type`: `threat-report`
    - `report_published`: Email sent date (converted to UTC)
    - `report_content`: Full email body (unparsed)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Connector Behavior

- Emails are **not modified** (not marked as read, deleted, etc.)
- The connector maintains its own state and remembers the last processed email timestamp.
- Emails are not parsed or enriched beyond report generation (by design).

---

## üìù Additional Information

- This connector does not perform enrichment or IOC extraction.
- It is designed to be extended or chained with other connectors for parsing.
- The connector is designed to support only IMAP-compatible mailboxes.
