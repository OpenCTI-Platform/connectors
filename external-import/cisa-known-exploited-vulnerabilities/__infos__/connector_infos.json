It serves as an authoritative resource for organizations to prioritize vulnerability remediation and enhance their security resilience.\n\nThe integration of the CISA KEV source with OpenCTI enables the ingestion of vulnerabilities known to be actively exploited. This process involves parsing out Identity, Infrastructure, and Vulnerability STIX Objects, which are then imported into OpenCTI.",
