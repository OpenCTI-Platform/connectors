## Introduction

NSFOCUS Threat Intelligence (NTI) is a specialized threat intelligence cloud platform established by NSFOCUS Technology to promote the construction of a cybersecurity ecosystem and the application of threat intelligence, enhancing customers' offensive and defensive capabilities. 

Leveraging the companyâ€™s professional security team and strong research capabilities, NTI continuously observes and analyzes global cybersecurity threats and trends. 

## Installation

The OpenCTI NTI connector is a standalone Python process that must have access to the OpenCTI platform and the RabbitMQ. RabbitMQ credentials and connection parameters are provided by the API directly, as configured in the platform settings.

Enabling NTI connector could be done by launching the Python process directly after providing the correct configuration in the `config.yml` file or within a Docker with the image `opencti/connector-NTI:latest`. We provide an example of [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) file that could be used independently or integrated to the global `docker-compose.yml` file of OpenCTI.

### Requirements

To use NTI-Connector, you need to apply for a NTI account.

For further details, please refer to our official website at https://nsfocusglobal.com, or reach out to us via email at nti-services@nsfocus.com.

- OpenCTI Platform >= 6.2.12

## Configuration variables

There are a number of configuration options, which are set either in `docker-compose.yml` (for Docker) or in `config.yml` (for manual deployment).

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

Make sure to replace the environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` with the appropriate configurations for your environment. Then, start the docker container with the provided docker-compose.yml

```shell
docker compose up -d
# -d for detached
```

## Usage

After Installation, the connector should require minimal interaction to use, and should update automatically at a regular interval specified in your `docker-compose.yml` or `config.yml` in `duration_period`.

However, if you would like to force an immediate download of a new batch of entities, navigate to:

`Data` -> `Ingestion` -> `Connectors` in the OpenCTI platform.

Find NTI connector, and click on the refresh button to reset the connector's state and force a new download of data by re-running the connector.

## Behavior

The NTI connector will pull latest feed packages. Feed packages are updated on a daily basis. The import process has the following steps:

 - Download feed packages from NTI.
 - Create indicators and `based-on` relationship between indicator and observables if `NTI_CREATE_IOC` is set to true.
 - If `NTI_CREATE_IP` is set to true, then create IP observables, `located-at` relationships between IP address and Locations, and `belongs-to` relationships between IP address and Autonomous System.
 - Create Domain observables and `resolves-to` relationship between Domain observables and IP observables if `NTI_CREATE_DOMAIN` is set to true.
 - Create File observables if `NTI_CREATE_FILE` is set to true.
 - Create URL observables if `NTI_CREATE_URL` is set to true.
