This integration enables security teams to centralise and enrich incident data from SentinelOne, facilitating comprehensive threat analysis and response.\n\nThis version of the connector creates the following objects in correspondence with a SentinelOne Incident: \n- An Incident with all pivotal information \n- Observable of the affected endpoint \n- Attack Patterns corresponding to the MITRE Attack Patterns identified for the Incident \n- Notes based on the actual notes made for the Incident \n- Indicators for any hashes of malicious files \n- An external reference to the Incident in SentinelOne if deeper analysis is required.",
