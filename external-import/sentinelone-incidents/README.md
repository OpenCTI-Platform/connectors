# OpenCTI SentinelOne Incident External Import Connector

This connector allows Incidents from a SentinelOne account to be created within an OpenCTI Instance

<br>

This software is provided as a community-driven project and is not officially supported by SentinelOne. It is offered on an "as-is" basis, without warranties or guarantees, either express or implied. Users are encouraged to thoroughly test and validate the software before deploying it in their environments. While community contributions and feedback are welcome, SentinelOne does not provide formal technical support, maintenance, or updates for this project.

<br>

- This version of the connector creates the following objects in correspondence with a SentinelOne Incident:
    - An Incident with all pivotal information
    - Observable of the affected endpoint
    - Attack Patterns corresponding to the MITRE Attack Patterns identified for the Incident
    - Notes based on the actual notes made for the Incident
    - Indicators for any hashes of malicious files
    - An external reference to the Incident in SentinelOne if deeper analysis is required.

<br>

## How It Works
The connector will create a corresponding OpenCTI Incident for `flagged` SentinelOne threats only.

<br>

- To `flag` a threat in SentinelOne, simply create a new note on the threat's page whose text is the value of `SENTINELONE_SEARCH_SIGN`. You will define this as an environment variable in the setup (`[OpenCTI_add]` by default).

<br>

- Each fetch interval, the connector will scan the threats on your SentinelOne account, triggering the creation process on those that are flagged. The interval between scans is determined by the enviroment variable `CONNECTOR_FETCH_INTERVAL` that you will define in seconds.

<br>

## Implementation
After appending the container to your compose file, you will need to create a new user in your OpenCTI instance and retrieve some information for your SentinelOne Account in order to interface with it 

<br>
<br>

### Retrieving Your Account ID

![Account ID In S1](doc/account_id.png)


- Click on the settings icon at the bottom of the left panel on the console. 
- From the `Settings` menu, select `ACCOUNTS` and click on the account you seek to use in the below list.
- You will now be in the `Sentinels` menu. From here, select `ACCOUNT INFO` (you may need to scroll to the right on smaller monitors to see it).
- Underneath your account name you will see your account ID in the field `ACCOUNT ID`



<br>

### Generating an API Key

![Generating An API Token In S1](doc/api_generation.png)

- Click on your email address in the top right corner of the menu on the SentinelOne Console. 
- Click the `Actions` dropdown button and hover over `API Token Operations`.
- Click `Regenerate API token` and proceed with the required Authentication.
- **Note:** you do not need to include the `'APIToken '`component of the string in any configs

<br>

### Determining Your SentinelOne URL
Your SentinelOne URL is simply the first component of the URL you use to access the console.

When configuring the connector, ensure that you include the ending '/'. For example, for the above image, you would input `https://usea1-purple.sentinelone.net/`

<br>

### Creating the Connector User
It is best practice to create a new user under the `Connectors` group and to use its token to interface with your instance.

![Generating A User In OpenCTI](doc/user_creation.png)


- Locate the gear (Settings) icon on the left menu and click `Security`.
- On the menu on the right click on the `Users` option. 
- Click the blue `+` icon at the bottom of the list
- Enter `[C] S1 Incident Connector`. **Note:** you can name this whatever you'd like, but you should include `[C]` at the start regardless.
- Enter the required information and ensure that under the `Groups` field `Connectors` is this selected option.
