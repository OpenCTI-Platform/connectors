| -------- | ---- | -------- | --------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| OPENCTI_URL | `string` | ✅ | Format: [`uri`](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string#built-in-formats) |  | The OpenCTI platform URL. |
| OPENCTI_TOKEN | `string` | ✅ | string |  | The token of the user who represents the connector in the OpenCTI platform. |
| CVE_API_KEY | `string` | ✅ | Format: [`password`](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string#built-in-formats) |  | API Key for the CVE API. |
| CONNECTOR_ID | `string` |  | string | `"cve--e0c380ad-6665-4f2e-8558-5d2610e5abcf"` | A unique UUIDv4 identifier for this connector instance. |
| CONNECTOR_NAME | `string` |  | string | `"Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures"` | Name of the connector. |
| CONNECTOR_SCOPE | `string` |  | string | `"cve"` | The scope or type of data the connector is importing, either a MIME type or Stix Object (for information only). |
| CONNECTOR_TYPE | `string` |  | string | `"EXTERNAL_IMPORT"` | Should always be set to EXTERNAL_IMPORT for this connector. |
| CONNECTOR_LOG_LEVEL | `string` |  | `debug` `info` `warn` `error` | `"error"` | Determines the verbosity of the logs. |
| CONNECTOR_DURATION_PERIOD | `string` |  | Format: [`duration`](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string#built-in-formats) | `"PT24H"` | Duration between two scheduled runs of the connector (ISO 8601 format). |
| CONNECTOR_QUEUE_THRESHOLD | `integer` |  | `0 < x ` | `null` | Connector queue max size in Mbytes. Default to 500. |
| CONNECTOR_RUN_AND_TERMINATE | `boolean` |  | boolean | `null` | Connector run-and-terminate flag. |
| CONNECTOR_SEND_TO_QUEUE | `boolean` |  | boolean | `null` | Connector send-to-queue flag. |
| CONNECTOR_SEND_TO_DIRECTORY | `boolean` |  | boolean | `null` | Connector send-to-directory flag. |
| CONNECTOR_SEND_TO_DIRECTORY_PATH | `string` |  | string | `null` | Connector send-to-directory path. |
| CONNECTOR_SEND_TO_DIRECTORY_RETENTION | `integer` |  | `0 < x ` | `null` | Connector send-to-directory retention in days. |
| CVE_BASE_URL | `string` |  | string | `"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves"` | URL for the CVE API. |
| CVE_INTERVAL | `integer` |  | `0 < x ` | `6` | Interval in hours to check and import new CVEs. Must be strictly greater than 1, advice from NIST minimum 2 hours. |
| CVE_MAX_DATE_RANGE | `integer` |  | `0 < x ` | `120` | Determines how many days to collect CVE. Maximum of 120 days. |
| CVE_MAINTAIN_DATA | `boolean` |  | boolean | `true` | If set to `True`, import CVEs from the last run of the connector to the current time. Takes 2 values: `True` or `False`. |
| CVE_PULL_HISTORY | `boolean` |  | boolean | `false` | If set to `True`, import all CVEs from start year define in history start year configuration and history start year is required. Takes 2 values: `True` or `False`. |
| CVE_HISTORY_START_YEAR | `integer` |  | `0 < x ` | `2019` | Year in number. Required when pull_history is set to `True`.  Minimum 2019 as CVSS V3.1 was released in June 2019, thus most CVE published before 2019 do not include the cvssMetricV31 object. |
