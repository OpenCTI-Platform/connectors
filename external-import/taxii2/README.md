### Collections and API roots
TAXII 2.0 introduced a new concept into the TAXII standard called an "API Root." API Roots are logical groupings of TAXII Collections and Channels that allow for better organization and federated access. More information can be found in the [TAXII2 standard](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/csprd01/taxii-v2.1-csprd01.pdf)

Unfortunately, the introduction of API Roots makes it more complicated to configure which Collections to poll from. To solve that issue, this connector uses dot notation to specify which collection(s) the user wants to poll, using the format `<API Root>.<Collection Name>`. So if you wanted to poll the `Enterprise ATT&CK` and `Mobile ATT&CK` collections in the API Root `stix` in MITRE's free TAXII2 server, your config variable would like

`stix.Enterprise ATT&CK,stix.Mobile ATT&CK`

Furthermore, this argument supports the use of `*` as a wildcard operator. To Poll all collections in the `STIX` API Root, you could use the syntax `stix.*` If you wanted to poll all collections in the server, you can use the syntax `*.*`

Finally, please note that the "title" of an API Root differs from it's pathing in a URL. For example, the title could be "Malware analysis" whereas the URL for an API Root could just be some_url/malware/. In the Collections parameters, please specify the URL path of an API Root, **not** its title
