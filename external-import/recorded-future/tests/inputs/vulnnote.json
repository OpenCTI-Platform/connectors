        "text": "In April 2022, Microsoft released patches for 119 vulnerabilities on its recurring Patch Tuesday disclosure. Similar to 2021, April sees the first time in the year that over 100 have been released; fortunately, while 2 of the vulnerabilities have been publicly disclosed prior to today, Microsoft has seen only 1 of the full 119 (CVE-2022-24521) exploited in the wild. This is good news for defenders in the face of other major vulnerability disclosures such as Spring4Shell in the last month. Of the 119 disclosed vulnerabilities, 10 are rated Critical by Microsoft, and aside from the exploited vulnerability, none are listed by Microsoft as receiving likely exploitation. Of the 10 critical vulnerabilities, 4 are of particular note, and all 10 are listed separately below.\n\nCVE-2022-24521 is a vulnerability in the Windows Common Log File System Driver that was reported by the National Security Agency. It allows for privilege escalation and may be paired with another bug. Microsoft reports that this vulnerability has been exploited in the wild, although it has not released further details about threat actors, victims, or methods associated with exploitation. As a result, this vulnerability should be the priority for patching. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.8.\n\nCVE-2022-26904 is a known zero-day vulnerability in the Windows User Profile Service. Microsoft reports that there is a proof-of-concept exploit with a Metasploit module. It has a CVSS score of 7.0 and is considered to have a high level of complexity for exploitation due to conditions beyond the attackerâ€™s control. While there are no reports yet of in-the-wild exploits, the availability of a proof-of-concept exploit opens the landscape up to a larger field of opportunistic cyber threat actors.\n\nBoth CVE 2022-26809 and CVE 2022-24491 are Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities affecting the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Runtime and the Windows Network File System and have CVSS scores of 9.8. Microsoft rated them both as critical vulnerabilities, which is expected given their RCE functionality. Defenders should patch and pay attention to both vulnerabilities since exploitation of this type of vulnerability already has precedent: an earlier Windows RPC vulnerability, CVE-2017-8461, was widely exploited and also received a Metasploit module. That said, we have not yet seen reports or indicators of exploitation of either vulnerability, nor even proof-of-concept exploits along the lines of CVE-2022-26904.\n\nThe complete 10 critical vulnerabilities are:\nCVE 2022-26809\nCVE 2022-24547\nCVE 2022-24546\nCVE 2022-24542\nCVE 2022-24491\nCVE 2022-24481\nCVE 2022-26914\nCVE-2022-26904\nCVE-2022-24474\nCVE-2022-24497",
