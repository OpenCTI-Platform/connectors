        March 12, 2024, Malwarebytes released a report concerning a malvertising campaign
        involving FakeBat. The report outlines how threat actors exploit potentially
        compromised legitimate websites, redirecting victims through Google referrers
        to decoy sites. These decoy sites span a variety of themes, such as OneNote,
        Epic Games, Ginger, and Braavos smart wallet application, as reported by Malwarebytes.\\n\\nThrough
        proactive hunting, Insikt Group identified additional infrastructure likely
        used by the same threat actor for both command and control and delivery purposes.
        The additional infrastructure suggests that other software products are being
        impersonated in associated malvertising campaigns. These organizations include
        Autodesk, AnyDesk, the Starknet wallet Argent, Discord, Rabby Wallet, the
        recording software Bandicam, Phantom wallet, and the 3D computer graphics
        software Blender.\\n\\nSuspected C2 Domains:\\nads-analyze[.]online\\nads-analyze[.]site\\nads-analyze[.]top\\nads-analyze[.]xyz\\nads-change[.]online\\nads-change[.]top\\nads-change[.]xyz\\nads-creep[.]top\\nads-creep[.]xyz\\nads-eagle[.]top\\nads-eagle[.]xyz\\nads-forget[.]top\\nads-hoop[.]top\\nads-hoop[.]xyz\\nads-moon[.]top\\nads-moon[.]xyz\\nads-pill[.]top\\nads-pill[.]xyz\\nads-star[.]site\\nads-star[.]top\\nads-star[.]xyz\\nads-strong[.]online\\nads-strong[.]site\\nads-strong[.]top\\nads-strong[.]xyz\\nads-tooth[.]top\\nads-tooth[.]xyz\\nads-work[.]site\\nads-work[.]top\\nads-work[.]xyz\\nwww[.]ads-analyze[.]top\\nwww[.]ads-analyze[.]xyz\\nwww[.]ads-change[.]online\\nwww[.]ads-change[.]top\\nwww[.]ads-change[.]xyz\\nwww[.]ads-creep[.]top\\nwww[.]ads-creep[.]xyz\\nwww[.]ads-eagle[.]xyz\\nwww[.]ads-forget[.]top\\nwww[.]ads-hoop[.]top\\nwww[.]ads-hoop[.]xyz\\nwww[.]ads-moon[.]top\\nwww[.]ads-moon[.]xyz\\nwww[.]ads-pill[.]top\\nwww[.]ads-pill[.]xyz\\nwww[.]ads-star[.]site\\nwww[.]ads-star[.]top\\nwww[.]ads-star[.]xyz\\nwww[.]ads-strong[.]online\\nwww[.]ads-strong[.]site\\nwww[.]ads-strong[.]top\\nwww[.]ads-tooth[.]top\\nwww[.]ads-tooth[.]xyz\\nwww[.]ads-work[.]top\\nwww[.]ads-work[.]xyz\\n\\nSuspected

        March 7, 2024, the Stormous Ransomware Group claimed responsibility for a
        ransomware attack against Duvel Moortgat, a prominent Belgian brewery, that
        disrupted its operations. The attack was first detected by Duvel\u2019s IT
        department, which led to the shutdown of its production lines to mitigate
        further damage. Ellen Aerts, a spokesperson for the brewery, confirmed the
        halt of production across all Belgian and one US site, assuring that efforts
        are underway to resume operations and that current stock levels will prevent
        any immediate shortage for consumers.\\n\\nStormous has escalated the situation
        by listing Duvel on its leak site, alleging the theft of 88 gigabytes of data
        and imposing a ransom deadline of March 25. Duvel has yet to publicly respond

        March 14, 2024, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
        disclosed five critical vulnerabilities in Mitsubishi Electric's MELSEC-Q/L
        Series controllers, which are widely used in factory automation settings.
        The vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2024-0802, CVE-2024-0803, CVE-2024-1915,
        CVE-2024-1916, and CVE-2024-1917, span various versions across the MELSEC-Q
        and MELSEC-L series. At the time of writing, there are no confirmed instances
        of the mentioned vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild.\\n\\nThe vulnerabilities
        are characterized as follows:\\n\\n- CVE-2024-0802 and CVE-2024-1915 are deemed
        critically severe, with a rating of 9.8, due to Incorrect Pointer Scaling
        issues. These vulnerabilities could enable threat actors to remotely manipulate
        or access data, or execute malicious  code on the compromised devices through
        specially crafted network packets.\\n- CVE-2024-0803, CVE-2024-1916, and CVE-2024-1917,
        each also rated with a severity of 9.8, stem from Integer Overflow or Wraparound
        issues. Such flaws could allow threat actors remotely run malicious code on
        the targeted systems by using specially designed packets.\\n\\nMitsubishi
        Electric advises users to implement several preventative actions to reduce
        the risk associated with these vulnerabilities:\\n\\n- Employ firewalls and
        virtual private networks (VPNs) to block unauthorized access, especially when
        Internet connectivity is necessary.\\n- Operate the affected products within
        a Local Area Network (LAN) and use firewalls to deny access from non-trusted
        networks and hosts.\\n- Limit physical access to the impacted products, along
        with the PCs and network devices that can interact with them.\\n- Install
        antivirus software on PCs that have access to the compromised products.\\n\\nCISA
        urges users to adopt protective measures to lower the exploitation risks of
        these vulnerabilities, such as:\\n\\n- Restricting the network visibility
        of all control system devices and/or systems to prevent internet access.\\n-
        CISA emphasizes the importance of conducting thorough impact analysis and
        risk assessment before implementing protective measures.\",\"topic\":[{\"id\":\"TXSFt5\",\"name\":\"Validated

        March 13, 2024, Cisco released advisories for a range of vulnerabilities in
        its IOS XR software, including three high-severity vulnerabilities: CVE-2024-20320,
        CVE-2024-20327, and CVE-2024-20318. These vulnerabilities affect various router
        series such as the Cisco 8000, NCS 540 and 5700, ASR 9000, and devices using
        Layer 2 Ethernet services. In addition to these, Cisco addressed multiple
        medium-severity vulnerabilities that pose risks of security bypass, denial
        of service (DoS), or the installation of unverified software images. These
        updates are included in Cisco's semiannual security bundle for IOS XR, a network
        operating system designed for scalability and reliability in high-end routers.
        There are no instances of confirmed exploitation of these vulnerabilities
        at the time of writing.\\n\\nDetails of the high-severity vulnerabilities
        are as follows:\\n\\n- CVE-2024-20320, resides in the SSH feature of IOS XR,
        where crafted SSH commands could enable threat actors to escalate privileges
        to root level. This vulnerability predominantly affects the 8000 series routers,
        as well as the Network Convergence System (NCS) 540 and 5700 series routers.
        Mitigation has been achieved with the release of IOS XR version 7.10.2, urging
        users of older versions to upgrade to this patched release to enhance security.\\n\\n-
        CVE-2024-20318, affects line cards equipped with the Layer 2 services feature.
        Threat actors could exploit this flaw by transmitting specific Ethernet frames
        to trigger a reset of the network processor on the line card, potentially
        leading to repeated resets and a DoS scenario. Cisco has addressed this issue
        in IOS XR software versions 7.9.2 and 7.10.1 and has also made available software
        maintenance upgrades (SMUs) that rectify the vulnerability.\\n\\n- CVE-2024-20318
        affects the PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) termination feature in ASR 9000 series
        routers, where improper processing of malformed PPPoE packets could lead to
        the crash of the ppp_ma process, disrupting PPPoE traffic. This vulnerability
        is pertinent to routers operating Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) functions
        with PPPoE termination on Lightspeed-based or Lightspeed-Plus-based line cards.
        Patches for this vulnerability have been integrated into IOS XR software releases
        7.9.21, 7.10.1, and 7.11.1.\",\"topic\":[{\"id\":\"TXSFt5\",\"name\":\"Validated

        March 14, 2024, the Russian cybersecurity firm F.A.C.C.T. reported that multiple
        threat actors have been abusing Embedded Subscriber Identity Module (eSIM)
        technology to facilitate SIM swapping attacks. An eSIM is a virtual SIM card
        that enables users to remotely manage cellular service on their devices without
        the need for a physical SIM card. The campaign specifically targets Russian
        users, wherein threat actors use already compromised credentials to gain access
        to their accounts. From there, the threat actors hijack users' phone numbers
        to ultimately take over the compromised accounts.  \\n\\nThe attack chain
        begins with SIM swappers obtaining credentials belonging to Russian users.
        The credentials were likely sourced from publicly-leaked data. The credentials
        are then used to lure legitimate carrier representatives into transferring
        the victim's phone number to a new eSIM card that is installed on the threat
        actor's device. Once SIM swappers gain control over the victim's phone number,
        they can intercept access codes and two-factor authentication (2FA) of online
        banking services for fund theft. According to FACCT,  SIM-linked social media
        accounts can also be compromised.\\n\\n\",\"topic\":[{\"id\":\"TXSFt5\",\"name\":\"Validated

        of this IO seeks to frame key leaders within the Israeli government and Israel
        Defense Forces (IDF) as being responsible for the October 7, 2023, attacks.
        Recent content reposted by Emerald Divide further supports this narrative,
        which describes historical Israel-Gaza events and suggests the Israeli civilian
        and military leadership\u2019s actions and decisions contributed to the organizational
        expansion of Hamas and subsequent October 7, 2023, attacks. Assessed target
        audiences for this IO includes primarily family members of those taken hostage
        or killed by Hamas and secondarily Israelis sympathetic towards those harmed
        as a result of the attacks by Hamas.\\n\\n\u25CF Infrastructure\\n\\nInfrastructure
        involved with this IO includes Telegram and The Jewish Voice website. On March
        14, 2024, the Telegram channel \u201CBoxing - Gush Katif - Returning Home\u201D
        (\u05D0\u05D2\u05E8\u05D5\u05E3 - \u05D2\u05D5\u05E9 \u05E7\u05D8\u05D9\u05E3-\u05D7\u05D5\u05D6\u05E8\u05D9\u05DD

        the Shin Bet to Iran\u2019s security services \u2014 made a post titled, \u201CThe
        same concept, the same failed generals\u201D. The post includes a hyperlink
        The Jewish Voice website (hakolhayehudi[.]co[.]il) featuring the \u201CSpecial
        Project - Gaza\u201D series. The post goes on to provide a quote from one
        of the articles in the series that summarizes a historical statement made
        by Israel\u2019s Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant, asserting Hamas would
        not take over the Gaza Strip. The post has received over 1,200 views.\\n\\nThe
        Jewish Voice \u201CSpecial Project - Gaza\u201D currently features four articles
        which are summarized as, \u201Chow the monster of terror [almost certainly
        referring to Hamas] grew: the failures of the right and the left [referring
        to Israel's political parties], the mistakes of the military and political
        echelons. How did we [Israel] fall asleep facing a bloodthirsty enemy?\u201D
        The articles recount historical events involving Israel and the Gaza Strip
        while implying that actions and decisions by leaders within Israel's government
        and military over the duration of multiple years contributed towards the rise
        of Hamas and ultimately the event of October 7, 2023.\\n\\nNotably, The Jewish
        Voice website has historically been associated with Israeli activists who
        were convicted by Israeli authorities for using the website to incite violence
        and racism. In 2017 two individuals confessed they used the website to advocate
        for violent actions such as \u201Cbreak open heads\u201D and \u201Cthrow Molotov
        cocktails\u201D. Consistent with activities associated with the Emerald Divide
        campaign in 2023 to incite conflict amongst Israelis on both the left and
        right of Israel\u2019s political spectrum, this IO very likely seeks to promote
        content published by The Jewish Voice website to increase social unrest.\\n\\n\u25CF
        Capabilities\\n\\nThis IO demonstrates various tactics, techniques, and procedures
        (TTPs) often associated with state-sponsored influence operations. Notable

        continues to project its strategic naval power and extend its maritime reach
        by cultivating key security relationships, amidst an ongoing maritime conflict
        perpetuated by its Yemeni Houthi proxies in the Red Sea. On March 15, 2024,
        Iran, China, and Russia wrapped up a joint naval exercise \u201CMarine Security
        Belt 2024\u201D in the Gulf of Oman, focused on protecting \u201Cmaritime
        economic activity\u201D. The naval drills are the sixth iteration since 2018,
        reflecting a larger trend of closer security ties between Iran and its two
        most powerful global partners. Additionally, the Wall Street Journal reported
        in early March 2024 that Iran had engaged Sudan to establish an Iranian naval
        base \u201Cfor intelligence gathering\u201D on the Sudanese coast of the Red
        Sea. Iran\u2019s naval ambitions almost certainly reflect its regional power
        projection goals, which have heightened relevance as Iran-backed Houthis continue
        to disrupt maritime commerce in the region.\\n\\nAccording to a Sudanese intelligence
        official, Tehran reportedly offered to provide Sudan with a helicopter-carrying
        naval vessel to acquire Sudan\u2019s agreement for a base. Iranian and Sudanese
        officials have denied the Wall Street Journal report on the Iranian naval
        base effort. Although the proposed deal is unconfirmed, Iran may have offered
        a capability similar to Iran\u2019s aircraft carriers \u2014 the Shahid Mahdavi
        and the Shahid Baqeri, commissioned by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps
        Navy (IRGCN) in 2023 \u2014 which are container ships converted into naval
        vessels capable of carrying helicopters and drones. Iran has reportedly supplied
        explosive drones to the Sudanese military for use in its civil conflict against
        a rebel paramilitary force, and likely sought to leverage its ongoing defense
        export relationship to expand Tehran\u2019s strategic foothold in the critical
        maritime artery. An Iranian naval base on Sudan\u2019s Red Sea coastline,
        which is 750 km long, would likely bolster Iran\u2019s naval presence and
        intelligence collection capabilities in the same waterways that Iran-backed
        Houthis are attacking commercial vessels. Additional Insikt Group analysis
        of IRGCN\u2019s naval capabilities can be accessed here: https://app.recordedfuture.com/portal/analyst-note/doc:qaomjx/true\\n\\nThe
        unverified proposal for an Iranian naval base in Sudan is consistent with
        Iran\u2019s increasing national effort to expand its naval reach beyond regional
        waters. On March 10, 2024, the head of Iranian Parliament\u2019s National
        Security and Foreign Policy Committee touted \u201Cthe diplomatic utility
        of maritime power\u201D as a critical national capability for Iran, and noted
        that \u201Cany nation that conquers the sea will undoubtedly wield global
        superior power\u201D. Given this strategic priority, Iran will very likely
        continue to build its naval presence and range by leveraging strategic or
        defense partnerships with anti-West or non-aligned countries across the globe.\\n\\nIran\u2019s
        participation in the Maritime Security Belt 2024 exercises with Russia and
        China reflects Tehran's effort to expand its security ties with the United
        States\u2019 (US) two largest challengers. Over 20 ships participated in the
        exercise, and Iran reported its navy intended to utilize new vessels \u201Cequipped
        for extended ocean missions\u201D in this year\u2019s exercises. Iran likely
        views the exercises as a signal to deter the US-led coalition conducting Operation
        Prosperity Guardian in the Red Sea and to contest the Western naval presence.\",\"topic\":[{\"id\":\"aUyI9M\",\"name\":\"Geopolitical

        to anonymous sources cited in a March 15, 2024, Bloomberg report, China\u2019s
        Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has requested that
        domestic car manufacturers expand purchasing of locally produced components
        and reduce importing of foreign components. MIIT is reportedly \u201Cdirectly
        instructing\u201D Chinese car companies like BYD Co. and Geely to \u201Cavoid
        foreign semiconductors if at all possible\u201D, likely to further the previously
        set goal of sourcing a fifth of all semiconductor chips for automobiles locally
        by 2025. Acceleration toward this goal is likely to decrease direct market
        and revenue opportunities in China for foreign semiconductor manufacturers,
        but Bloomberg asserts the foreign firms \u201Ceffectively have to manufacture
        their silicon through a local foundry\u201D. Assuming Bloomberg\u2019s reporting
        is accurate, MIIT\u2019s actions are likely motivated by geopolitical and
        geoeconomic trends; China is seeking greater innovation, capacity, and self-reliance
        in its technology sector both as a means to move up the economic value chain
        and to insulate itself from external influence \u2014 such as United States-led

        Summary\\nOn December 12, 2023, Insikt Group observed advertisements on dark
        web forums related to a new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) program called
        \u201CKryptina\u201D. At the beginning of February 2024, its source code with
        documentation was publicly shared across several English, Russian, and Chinese-speaking
        dark web forums and marketplaces by the moniker \u201CCorlys\u201D. Despite
        the announcement of the RaaS program, Corlys was not observed hiring any affiliate
        members, no forum members taking an interest in joining, nor the threat actor
        offering any profit share options for potential ransomware operators. Due
        to this lack of interest from forum users joining as affiliates and the ransomware
        not gaining in popularity, we believe this was the motivation as to why Corlys
        publicly shared the ransomware\u2019s source code.\\n\\nThe latest Kryptina
        ransomware version 2.2 was initially shared on February 2, 2024 on the forums
        BreachForums 2 and XSS by Corlys. Shortly after these postings, similar advertisements
        were observed on Ramp Forum and Chang\u2019An Sleepless Night by the threat
        actors \u201CTheShadowHacker\u201D and \u201CC**z\u201D, who we believe are
        likely not related to the developer and used the shared source code in an
        attempt to monetize it or to increase their reputation.\\n\\nPlease see the

        likely ongoing coordinated influence operation (IO), involving multiple assets
        previously attributed to Russian IOs, is attempting to undermine threat intelligence
        community research credibility into the Russia-linked IO network Doppelg\xE4nger
        through articles suggesting that the US State Department is orchestrating
        the campaign with the cooperation of Russian dissidents. This IO utilizes
        news articles published in several European languages, images of almost certainly
        inauthentic email communications, and social media amplification to establish
        credibility and increase the visibility of the claims.\\n\\nOn March 8, 2024,
        the New York News Daily (NY News Daily, nynewsdaily[.]org), published an article
        titled \u201CShadow Play, The U.S. Hand In Global Disinformation And Regime
        Change\u201D, which details an investigation into Doppelg\xE4nger and the
        US State Department's alleged role in Doppelg\xE4nger to discredit the Kremlin
        in collaboration with Russian opposition figures. Insikt Group notes that
        on March 7, 2024, the New York Times (NYT) highlighted NY News Daily as one
        of four Russian-linked disinformation websites targeting US audiences. [1]\\n\\nThe
        article claims that ALPHV Ransomware Group (referred to as \u201CBlackCat
        hacker group\u201D) purportedly accessed \u201Cpersonal computers of several
        senior officials\u201D of the US State Department, adding that the breach
        \u201Cafforded the hackers unfettered access to the social media accounts
        and email inboxes of employees within the Office for Assistance Abroad and
        the Office for European and Eurasian Affairs\u201D. The article adds that
        the threat actors reportedly also gained access to the personal inbox of the
        director of the Office of Assistance Abroad, Tamara Wittes. According to NY
        News Daily, emails exfiltrated from an email address owned by Wittes included
        communications with a \u201Ccadre of unidentified individuals, presumably
        from Russia, disseminating cloned content from major news agencies across
        Europe and America to manipulate public opinion\u201D. The article further
        notes that \u201CWestern media have regularly reported on the group\u2019s
        endeavors, attributing to them a series of pro-Russian and anti-Ukrainian
        propaganda efforts\u201D. In support of this statement, the article links
        multiple research pieces featured on the EU DisinfoLab website dedicated to
        Doppelg\xE4nger, and includes a screenshot of Doppelg\xE4nger-attributed X
        (formerly Twitter) posts featured in Insikt Group\u2019s December 2023 report,
        \u201CObfuscation and AI Content in the Russian Influence Network \u201CDoppelg\xE4nger\u201D
        Signals Evolving Tactics\u201D.\\n\\nTo support the article\u2019s accusations,
        the outlet claims that it had received screenshots (presented in the body
        of the article) of email communications between Wittes and Dmitry Nizovtsev,
        a Russian journalist and prominent figure in the \u201CAnti-Corruption Foundation\u201D,
        an organization founded by the late Alexei Navalny. The alleged email conversation,
        dated February 5, 2024, includes \u201CWittes\u201D congratulating \u201CNizovtsev\u201D
        for Doppelg\xE4nger\u2019s successes, and adding that [the State Department]
        \u201Cneed to use your network in Italy now\u201D. \u201CWittes\u201D claims
        the State Department received information indicating that Italian farmers
        were planning to participate in protests in major Italian cities in mid-February
        2024. According to \u201CWittes\u201D, she states they need Doppelg\xE4nger
        to \u201Crun a media campaign [in Italy] to blame the Russians\u201D. The
        initial email adds \u201CYour task is to urgently use Doppelg\xE4nger accounts
        and websites to support these protests. It is important that all articles
        and posts clearly show a pro-Russian position. As soon as the campaign goes
        viral enough, we will release an investigation that will point to the Kremlin
        as the organizer of Italian protests\u201D. In a response, \u201CNizovtsev\u201D
        states his team will \u201Cimmediately launch clone websites of ANSA agency
        [Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata] and accounts in social media to promote
        them\u201D.\\n\\nBased on Insikt Group analysis, the email communication is
        almost certainly inauthentic based on the following characteristics:\\n\\n\u2022
        In the screenshots, Wittes uses a Gmail account rather than an official US
        government email account to communicate with Nizovtsev, which we would expect
        in any external engagements on behalf of the US State Department. The managers
        of this IO likely opted to impersonate US State Department communications
        through a private Gmail account to introduce some degree of plausibility that
        ALPHV accessed State officials\u2019 personal accounts.\\n\u2022 There is
        no evidence that ALPHV recently compromised the US State Department or key
        State Department officials, as ALPHV would almost certainly publicize a successful
        attack via leaking contents of a successful breach on their dedicated leak
        site. [2]\\n\u2022 The State Department is almost certainly not behind Doppelg\xE4nger,
        based on research from Insikt Group, numerous other research teams, and both
        the French government and Meta attribution to \u2022 \u2022 Russian companies
        Social Design Agency and Structura National Technologies.\\nThe Gmail address
        allegedly belonging to Wittes in the screenshotted email communication is
        not the same Gmail account Insikt Group assesses as likely belonging to Wittes
        based on open source searches.\\n\\nBased on pro-Russian Telegram coverage
        of the story, we have identified a website promoting the article that serves
        as a likely sister website to NY News Daily, \u201CClear Story News\u201D
        (clearstory[.]news). Insikt Group also identified Clear Story News via an
        email address domain (info@falconeye[.]tech) provided at the end of a Miami
        Chronicle (miamichron[.]com, a related influence website) \u201Crebuttal\u201D
        to the NYT for its March 7, 2024, report on the websites\u2019 likely Russian
        links. The domain falconeye[.]tech currently redirects to clearstory[.]news.\\n\\nFurthermore,
        we have also identified a likely French-language sister website tied to the
        four Russia-linked websites featured in the NYT report, the \u201CInformations
        Ind\xE9pendantes News Corporation\u201D (\u201CInfosindependants\u201D, infosindependants[.]fr).
        Infosindependants published the article on its website the same day as NY
        News Daily/Clear Story News.\\n\\nInsikt Group has tracked this article across
        several pro-Russian propaganda networks previously attributed to Russian IO
        campaigns. In addition to the aforementioned article on NY News Daily, previously
        Russia-attributed IO networks amplifying the story include:\\n\u2022 Pravda
        (specifically pravda-en[.]com), a Russian website the French government recently
        linked to the Russian IO campaign \u201CPortal Kombat\u201D [3] [4];\\n\u2022
        InfoDefense, a pro-Russian Telegram network previously identified by Insikt

        [5] [6],\\n\u2022 The Intel Drop, a conspiratorial English-language website
        Insikt Group linked to Russian intelligence through its connections with Veteran\u2019s
        Today in July 2022. [7]\\n\\nIn addition to amplification through known propaganda
        networks, we have observed wide Telegram promotion across pro-Russian Telegram
        sources, as well as periodic mentions throughout March 8, 2024, on social
        media, particularly on Gab and X. Most notably, the NY News Daily\u2019s allegations
        were boosted on X by \u201Cpolitical commentator\u201D Tyler Popp, as well
        as American expatriate living in Russia, Tara Reade. Together, both Popp and
        Reade\u2019s posts received more than 75,000 views and 600 engagements. Additional
        X amplification via accounts @IslanderReports and @pepesgrandma contributed
        to an additional 175,000 views and dozens of additional engagements.\\n\\nThere
        is also evidence of broader attempts to amplify the allegations across Europe,
        including in German (via uncutnews[.]ch), Italian (via farodiroma[.]it, NY
        News Daily cites FarodiRoma as the original source), Czech (via infokuryr[.]cz),
        Serbian (via vaseljenska[.]net), and Slovak (via armadnymagazin[.]sk), based
        on backlinks to the original NY News Daily article.\\n\\n\u2022 Currently,
        Insikt Group assesses that this IO is likely attributed to Russia, but cannot
        confirm a specific group as responsible, noting the several previously Russia-linked
        IO actors that are promoting the story. According to the NYT, NY News Daily
        and its related websites share links to residual elements of Russian oligarch
        Yevgeny Prigozhin\u2019s media conglomerates, however, we have not confirmed
        this.\\n\u2022 The operation very likely seeks to not only discredit existing
        Western research into the Doppelg\xE4nger network by \u201Cunveiling\u201D
        the campaign of US origin but is also an attempt to establish future credibility
        concerns for researchers ahead of future reports into the network and Doppelg\xE4nger\u2019s
        Russian nexus.\\n\u2022 Furthermore, NY News Daily\u2019s report on the State
        Department \u201Cleaks\u201D is likely a Russian form of retaliation for leaks
        that targeted the Social Design Agency in mid-February 2024, featured in the
        Washington Post. Very likely credible documents contained as part of the leak
        highlighted significant involvement among senior Kremlin officials and Social
        Design Agency in tasking Doppelg\xE4nger content in Ukraine and throughout
        Europe.\\n\u2022 The report is also a likely demonstration of the Kremlin\u2019s
        continued attempts to shape international perceptions of the US State Department
        as a malign actor inside Russia. Previously, the Kremlin accused the United
        States Agency for International Development (USAID) of facilitating political
        unrest in Russia, for which the Kremlin then banned USAID from operating in
        Russia. Additionally, the Kremlin has also suggested that the US Embassy in
        Moscow was attempting to foment domestic unrest by listing the physical location
        of protest events in support of Alexei Navalny, and more recently, conducting
        political interference ahead of Russia\u2019s upcoming presidential elections.\\n\\nThis
        influence operation demonstrates various tactics, techniques, and procedures
        (TTPs) often associated with state-sponsored influence operations. Notable
        TTPs include:\\n\u2022 Undermine Western research into Doppelg\xE4nger by

        March 12, 2024, FortiGuard Labs reported on a phishing campaign deploying
        the VCURMS and STRRAT Remote Access Trojans (RAT) through a Java downloader.
        The threat actors used public cloud services, including Amazon Web Services
        (AWS) and GitHub, to host their malicious payloads. The command and control
        server for the RAT communication is hosted through ProtonMail, using the address
        sacriliage@proton[.]me.  \\nThe initial phase of the attack involves a phishing
        email misleading recipients into downloading a malicious Java archive (.jar)
        file from AWS, supposedly to verify payment information. They also use Branchlock
        to obfuscate these files and evade detection (some of the obfuscated code
        also appears to be generated by  Sense Shield Virbox Protector). Upon execution,
        this file fetches two additional JAR files that launches both trojans. VCURMS
        then sends an email to the threat actor stating \u201CHey master, I am online\u201D
        and periodically checks the victim\u2019s email for specific subject lines.\\n\\nBecause
        VCURMS uses ProtonMail for command and control communications, this allows
        \ it to execute commands, gather system information, and manage files via
        email instructions. VCURMS extracts data from applications like Discord, steam,
        and web browsers, as well as downloads other malware like keyloggers (Kl.jpg)
        and information stealers (Stl2.jpg). STRRAT on the other hand, employs complex
        obfuscation techniques to avoid detection while performing keylogging and
        credential theft. Fortinet notes that VCURMS resembles past versions of Rude
        Stealer malware. \\n\",\"topic\":[{\"id\":\"TXSFt5\",\"name\":\"Validated

        Armed Forces, very likely troops from the Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK), Freedom
        of Russia Legion (LSR), and Siberian Battalion units, are carrying out an
        ongoing offensive operation in the territories of Russia, specifically the
        Belgorod and Kursk regions. The operations began on March 12, 2024. Insikt
        Group assesses that the offensive operations are very likely intended to disrupt
        the presidential election in Russia.\\n\\nUkrainian Armed Forces have been
        carrying out offensive operations in Russia since March 12, 2024. Specifically,
        Ukrainian forces carried out operations in Kozinka, and Sporadyushino villages
        in Belgorod oblast, and Tetkino village in Kursk oblast. According to Russian
        government officials, as of March 14, 2024, Russian forces repelled the attacks,
        killing at least 679 Ukrainian forces, and destroying 19 tanks, 17 armored
        vehicles, including US-provided Bradley infantry fighting vehicles (IFV),
        and artillery equipment, including one US-provided M-777 howitzer. Similarly,
        Ukrainian forces reported destroying Russian military equipment and two ammunition
        depots in Tetkino, Kursk. Insikt Group is unable to confirm claims made by
        Russia or Ukraine.\\n\\nThis is not the first time Ukrainian forces carried
        out offensive operations in internationally recognized Russian territories.
        Most notably, in May and June 2023, RDK and LSR forces carried out an offensive
        operation in Belgorod, forcing the Russian government to increase defenses
        in Belgorod and deploy National Guard of Russia forces as well as Akhmat forces
        of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov.\\n\\nDespite Ukrainian forces stating that
        the goal of the operation is to destroy Russian military positions in Belgorod
        and Kursk, Insikt Group assesses that the offensive operations are very likely
        motivated by political objectives, specifically to disrupt Russia\u2019s presidential
        election, which will take place between March 15 to March 17, 2024. We primarily
        base this assessment on previous Ukrainian offensive operations and the minimal
        military impact of the current incursion.\\n\\nSpecifically, in the past,
        when Ukrainian forces carried out offensive operations with the intention
        of disrupting Russian military capabilities, they used unmanned aerial vehicles
        and long-range missiles to destroy Russian military assets. For example, in
        August 2023, very likely Ukrainian forces carried out UAV attacks on Soltsy-2
        airbase in Russia, destroying at least one Tu-22M supersonic strategic bomber.\\nCurrent
        and previous incursions into Belgorod and Kursk regions have had limited military
        impact on Russia\u2019s military capabilities, based on statements made by
        Russia and Ukraine. While these operations highlight Russia\u2019s failure
        to protect its territory near Ukraine, they do not change Russia\u2019s military
        posture.\\nAs the incursion on Belgorod did not attempt to destroy Russian
        military capabilities, we assess that the goal of the operation was based
        on political calculations, rather than military.\",\"topic\":[{\"id\":\"aUyI9M\",\"name\":\"Geopolitical

        collaborative effort by researchers from Google DeepMind, Open AI, ETH Zurich,
        McGill University, and the University of Washington has discovered a new vulnerability
        that allowed the extraction of critical architecture information from proprietary
        large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Google PaLM-2, Dark Reading
        reported on March 14, 2024. The technical report stated that by interacting
        with the AI models through their APIs, the team managed to pull out detailed
        architectural data of these models, which are usually kept secret by their
        creators for competitive advantages and safety concerns (or in a \u201Cblackbox\u201D).\\n\\nThe
        researchers managed to extract critical details from AI models for less than
        $20 worth of queries of  the models' APIs, focusing on the final layer responsible
        for generating responses. This \\\"top-down\\\" approach allowed them to identify
        and retrieve the models' embedding projection matrix, a key piece of architecture
        that reveals how input data is processed into outputs. By doing so, the team
        gathered essential insights on how the models are structured internally, enabling
        potential replication or modification of the AI models themselves.\\n\",\"topic\":[{\"id\":\"TXSFt5\",\"name\":\"Validated

        March 15, 2024, GitHub user Hagrid29 published a proof-of-concept (PoC) script
        designed to exploit CVE-2024-2432, a privilege escalation vulnerability affecting
        Palo Alto GlobalProtect VPN application versions 6.1.1-5 and 6.2.0-89 on Windows
        systems. GlobalProtect is a virtual private network (VPN) solution developed
        by Palo Alto Networks, designed to provide secure remote access to corporate
        networks and resources for users located outside of the corporate firewall.
        According to a security advisory published by Palo Alto Networks, CVE-2024-2432
        allows an unprivileged local user to escalate their privileges on the system
        through a symbolic link attack, leading to arbitrary file deletion. Palo Alto
        Networks addressed the vulnerability in GlobalProtect app versions 5.1.12,
        6.0.8, 6.1.2, 6.2.1, and all subsequent releases for Windows.\\n\\nCVE-2024-2432
        stems from the improper handling of file operations by the \\\"PanGpHip.exe\\\"
        process, which is executed with SYSTEM privileges. Specifically, the process
        indiscriminately attempts to remove files and folders within certain directories
        related to VPN connections without proper validation, making it vulnerable
        to symbolic link attacks. This enables non-privileged local users to manipulate
        symbolic links within the temporary directory structure used by GlobalProtect,
        tricking the process into deleting arbitrary files, and leading to potential
        local privilege escalation (LPE).\\n\\nBased on the repository, the PoC requires
        command-line inputs, including the type of operation (delete or privilege
        escalation), a target file or rollback script to be used, and the chosen exploitation
        method. Once provided, the PoC performs the following exploitation:\\n\\nFile
        deletion:\\n\u2022  Method 1: This method begins by creating a temporary directory
        and a file named 12345.txt (by default) within it, serving as a trigger for
        an opportunistic lock (oplock). Upon the oplock trigger, the PoC attempts
        to move files, create junctions, and establish symbolic links, exploiting
        potential race conditions in the file system. Using oplocks, the PoC aims
        to manipulate file system structures and permissions to gain control over
        the targeted files.\\n\u2022  Method 2: Similar to Method 1, this method involves
        creating two files (12345.txt and 11111.txt, by default) in separate directories
        (waapi and fakedir) within the temporary directory. By creating multiple files
        in different locations, the PoC aims to trigger a race condition between the
        creation and deletion of these files.\\n\\nPrivilege escalation:\\n\u2022
        \ Method 1: In this method, the PoC waits for Windows Installer to create
        the C:\\\\Config.msi directory and .rbs file (rollback script) within it.
        Once the directory and file are created, the PoC creates a copy of C:\\\\Config.Msi
        with a weak DACL. The PoC replaces the original C:\\\\Config.msi with the
        copy, and replaces the rollback script with a new .rbs file generated by the
        PoC. This new .rbs file contains a payload, allowing the PoC to execute arbitrary
        code with SYSTEM privileges when the script is executed by the Windows Installer
        service. This method uses weaknesses in file system permissions and service
        execution to escalate privileges from user-level access to SYSTEM-level access.\\n\u2022
        \ Method 2: Similar to Method 1, this method involves waiting for the creation
        of the rollback script within the C:\\\\Config.msi directory. However, it
        introduces a race condition by creating two directories (waapi and fakedir)
        and two files (12345.txt and 11111.txt, by default) within them. The PoC exploits
        the race condition to ensure that the payload file overwrites the rollback

        failures, given that the predominant attacks to its entities were data breaches.
        The second was financial fraud, as it relates to exposure risk of data collected
        by consumer goods companies.\\n\\nLegal or Compliance Failures:\\n\\nThe most
        common attacks to plague consumer and retail goods entities in 2023 were data
        breaches and ransomware attacks, such as the breach of eyewear giant Luxottica,
        which exposed the data of a staggering 70 million customers. Other retail
        and consumer goods companies breached this year included: Est\xE9e Lauder,
        Pepsi Bottling Ventures, Yum! Brands, and Essendant. Over time, these have
        translated to a legal and compliance risk for companies in the form of an
        increased risk of class action lawsuits.\\n\\nConsumers are increasingly seeking
        remediation through class action lawsuits from breaches. According to CSO
        Online, class action lawsuits as a result of data breaches in the US have
        cost companies over $4 billion in fines. On the other hand, companies are
        implementing arbitration clauses and class action waivers in their terms and
        conditions to mitigate the legal risk of class actions (although these were
        only recently upheld by courts).\\n\\nFinancial Fraud:\\n\\nThe amount of
        personal data that the consumer goods sector handles elevates the probability
        of financial fraud being a consequence of a cyberattack. We assess that these
        consequences will only continue to increase based on the amount of personally
        identifiable information (PII) contained in breaches, as well as sensitive
        and protected information such as personal financial or health information.
        In the consumer and retail goods sector, the ubiquity of customer loyalty
        programs are a sector-specific risk concerning personal data.\\n\\nFor instance,
        in 2023, the fast food entity Chick-fil-A suffered a credential-stuffing attack
        against its customer loyalty program that affected 71,000 customers. The attack
        resulted in customer accounts being sold on Telegram channels. As a result,
        Chick-fil-A had to freeze many customers\u2019 gift card balances and remove
        stored payment methods to prevent fraudulent purchases, likely causing a disruption
        in revenue as Chick-fil-A customers were temporarily unable to make purchases.
        We anticipate that despite the rapid mitigation efforts from Chick-fil-A,
        the value of the data in customer loyalty programs will continue to drive
        cyber attacks.\",\"topic\":[{\"id\":\"t38oMj\",\"name\":\"Executive Insights\",\"type\":\"Topic\"}],\"context_entities\":[{\"id\":\"J0Nl-p\",\"name\":\"Ransomware\",\"type\":\"MalwareCategory\"},{\"id\":\"B_Zah\",\"name\":\"Estee

        March 14, 2024, Russia deployed non-strategic nuclear weapons (NSNW) into
        Belarus, according to unidentified Western government officials. According
        to the same source, the deployment is associated with a June 2023 Kremlin
        announcement that Belarus would receive short-range ballistic missiles (SRMB),
        almost certainly Russia\u2019s ISKANDER (NATO Designation: SS-26 STONE). Based
        on our understanding of Russian tactical missile disposition in Eastern Europe,

        is positioned in western Belarus. Because of this, the official deployment
        of nuclear capabilities within Belarus is almost certainly a show of force,

        Russian and Belarussian messaging associated with ISKANDER as NATO\u2019s

        March 15, 2024, NewsGuard \u2014 an organization that researches misinformation
        and disinformation as well as provides trust ratings for news and information
        websites \u2014 published an article analyzing a recent trending online narrative
        suggesting that outages experienced on Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram
        during Super Tuesday on March 5, 2024, were part of a larger election interference
        scheme. Following the outage officials from the United States (US) National
        Security Council and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), refuted
        any claims of malicious activity targeting Super Tuesday elections and representatives
        of Meta reported the outage was due to an unspecified \u201Ctechnical issue\u201D.
        This false narrative demonstrates how various organizations and actors will
        very likely continue seeking opportunities based on dynamic events to project
        misinformation or disinformation that provides opportunistic gain as the 2024
        US elections approach.\\n\\n\u25CF Narrative and Audience\\n\\nThe primary
        narrative suggests that Facebook and Instagram were deliberately disabled
        during Super Tuesday as part of a rehearsal for the 2024 US elections scheduled
        for November 5, 2024. Alternative media and social media users referred to
        the outage as a \u201Cpractice run for November\u201D suggesting \u201CEverything
        is intentional\u201D. Notably, NewsGuard identified such claims as similar
        to articles published by The Gateway Pundit and The People\u2019s Voice on
        February 24, 2024, falsely stating voters in South Carolina were unable to
        vote during the state\u2019s primary election due to internet outages. The
        intended audience for this narrative is likely US citizens susceptible to
        conspiracy theories involving US elections.\\n\\n\u25CF Infrastructure\\n\\nInfrastructure
        involved with this narrative includes the WND News Center website (wnd[.]com)
        as well as Telegram and X (formerly known as Twitter). On March 5, 2024, WND
        News Center published an article titled, \u201CPractice run for November?'
        Facebook, related sites go dark on Super Tuesday\u201D. The article provides
        a summary of the outage suggesting it was intentionally planned to correspond
        with Super Tuesday. Other suggestions within the article related to the outage
        include a reference to Dominion Voting Systems which states, \u201Csomeone
        flipped the wrong switch and instead of getting into the Dominion system,
        they got Meta\u201D. Additionally, the article features an embedded poll with
        the question, \u201COnline poll: Is the Facebook outage directly related to
        the elections?\u201D, with the option of selecting \u201Cyes\u201D or \u201Cno\u201D.\\n\\nThe
        WND News Center article includes a hyperlink to a post made by the X account
        \u201CDC_Draino\u201D (@DC_Draino) that states, \u201CWhat a coincidence that
        Facebook, Instagram, and Youtube are down on Super Tuesday, Practice run for
        November?\u201D The post received significant engagement with over 3.2 million
        views, 13,000 reposts, and over 53,000 likes. Telegram user @MJTruth made
        another notable social media post amplifying this narrative on the Telegram
        channel t[.]me/candlesinthenight. Referring to the outages the post states,
        \u201CThat is not a coincidence\u2026 The very definition of a \u2018Dry-Run\u2019
        is a \u2018rehearsal of a performance or pressure before the real one\u2019\u201D
        and features a graphic with the logos of multiple social media platforms alongside
        the controversial cartoon known as Pepe the Frog (also known as Sad Frog).
        The post suggests that based on the outages, Twitter (X), Telegram, Truth
        Social, and Rumble \u201Cmay very well be the only ones available on Election
        day\u201D, almost certainly referring to November 5, 2024. The post received
        over 32,800 views, 900 likes, and 110 comments.\\n\\n\u25CF Capabilities\\n\\nThis

        March 12, 2024, malware researcher S! Ri (@siri_urz on X, formerly known as
        Twitter) shared an instance of an information stealer targeting users of Live
        Ledger, a cryptocurrency wallet management software. Specifically, this information
        stealer targets seed phrases, a series of words used to backup and recover
        a user\u2019s cryptocurrency wallet. The malware is also capable of killing
        Live Ledger processes on a victim machine and displaying a phishing window.
        According to X user @herrcore, they observed a similar incident in November
        2023. S! Ri noted that the stealer\u2019s code has significantly changed since
        their last analysis of the malware in 2023.\\n\\nInsikt Group obtained the
        information stealer sample (SHA256: 0e4ffba62ce9a464aa1b7ff9f1e55ace8f51ff1e15102d856f801a81f8b4607d)
        shared by S! Ri from Recorded Future Malware Intelligence. Sandbox analysis
        detected the sample as malicious due to the sample exhibiting persistence
        and stealware capabilities. Once executed, the sample performs the following
        actions on a victim\u2019s machine:\\n\u2022  Uses the Windows command prompt
        (CMD) to ping the IP address 2.2.2[.]2 once, wait for 3 seconds, and then
        delete itself\\n\u2022  Conducts API hooking and reflective portable executable
        (PE) injection\\n\u2022  Queries the Windows registry to check the victim
        machine\u2019s location\\n\u2022  Adds a Windows registry Run key entry named
        \u201CLedger-Live Updater\u201D that executes itself located inside the \u201CC:\\\\Users\\\\Admin\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\\u201D

        March 14, 2024, cybersecurity firm Tarlogic (TarlogicSecurity on GitHub and
        @Tarlogic on X, formerly known as Twitter) published BlueSpy, a Python-based
        proof-of-concept (PoC) tool designed to secretly record and replay audio from
        a Bluetooth device (such as a Bluetooth headset) without the user's knowledge.
        According to the repository, BlueSpy aims to highlight the vulnerabilities
        in Bluetooth device security and advocate for the adoption of a standardized
        security evaluation methodology, such as the Bluetooth Security Assessment
        Methodology (BSAM). BSAM provides a standardized framework for evaluating
        and improving the security of Bluetooth devices and connections. Per Tarlogic,
        BlueSpy exploits the failure to comply with specific controls within BSAM
        to bypass user interaction requirements during the pairing procedure and exposes
        the device's functionality to any nearby agent within Bluetooth signal range.
        Tarlogic already notified manufacturers of devices that possess vulnerabilities.\\n\\nBlueSpy
        uses the following command-line tools to carry out the recording and playback
        processes:\\n\u2022  bluetoothctl: for controlling Bluetooth devices\\n\u2022
        \ btmgmt: for managing Bluetooth controllers and connections\\n\u2022  pactl:
        for controlling PulseAudio sound server\\n\u2022  parecord: for recording
        audio from PulseAudio sources\\n\u2022  paplay: for playing audio through
        PulseAudio\\n\\nBased on the repository, BlueSpy requires command-line inputs,
        including a target device MAC address, address type, file to store recorded
        audio, and audio sink to play the audio back. Once provided, BlueSpy uses
        the following scripts to carry out its operation:\\n\u2022  pair.py: uses
        the command-line tool btmgmt to modify the configuration of the \u201CBlueZ\u201D
        Bluetooth stack and initiate a pairing process with the targeted Bluetooth
        device.\\n\u2022  connect.py: uses the command-line tool bluetoothctl to conduct
        a quick scan and establish a connection with the Bluetooth device. Once paired,
        this script handles the process of establishing a connection to the device.\\n\u2022
        \ just_record.py: initiates a recording session using the command-line tools
        pactl and parecord. It searches for the Bluetooth device in the system's audio
        sources, ensuring it functions as a microphone, and then begins recording
        audio from it.\\n\\nAfter recording, BlueSpy prompts the operator to play
        the audio back using the command-line tool paplay and exits.\\n\\nAt the time
        of writing, BlueSpy has gained 48 \u201Cstars\u201D and has been forked 10
        times on GitHub. The Validation URL section of this note contains a link to

        of the malware, with XSS users responding with questions regarding how to
        operate XSSLite and requests for additional functionality. However, one user
        alleges that, while the malware is passable, \u201Cit\u2019s a shame they\u2019ll
        kill you quickly\u201D, likely referring to threat researchers creating detections
        for XSSLite or law enforcement performing takedowns of XSSLite web panels.
        While most comments were positive, we did observe some users negatively criticizing
        XSSLite\u2019s code and functionality.\\n\\nInsikt Group analysts performed
        static analysis on the forked sample shared by S! Ri (SHA256: 65da3824b373ed19b61bd1a4f4d132884c742755e2fdb755300cdd1b719246e9)
        to identify the sample\u2019s capabilities and determine if file and/or log-based
        detection opportunities were present. Insikt Group and other malware researchers
        previously identified various string-based artifacts within the sample, including
        an unsanitized PDB path and a hardcoded IP address directing to a web panel
        for \u201CDmitry Stealer\u201D.\\n\\nAdditionally, Insikt Group identified
        the developer\u2019s signature, a string stating \u201CMade by the CognitoInc
        coder for the xss forum\u201D and strings associated with the malware\u2019s
        functionality, including strings related to browser data grabbing, cryptocurrency
        wallet grabbing, virtual machine (VM) detection and evasion, and remote server
        contact. Using these strings, Insikt Group created a YARA rule capable of
        detecting XSSLite samples, which successfully identified 3 previously unreported
        samples which we believe to be modified versions of XSSLite:\\n\\n\u2022 52e980cd0ed565f7ea12ef25c36e9e7477873a9e171e1db6fd37ced18b5043f5\\n\u2022

        Group investigated XSSLite\u2019s original source code, shared by CognitoInc
        in the same forum post that XSSLite was initially advertised on, to gain a
        better understanding of how the malware operates. The source code includes
        a document from the developer titled \u0418\u043D\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043A\u0446\u0438\u044F.txt
        in Russian, or Instructions.txt in English, discussing how to set up XSSLite.
        This file includes a full list of capabilities XSSLite is equipped with, including
        (written verbatim as translated by Google Translate):\\n\\n\u2022 \u201CCollection
        of Chromium browsers\u201D\\n\u2022 \u201CGrabber files from the desktop\u201D\\n\u2022
        \u201CCollection of absolutely all plugins from the browser\u201D\\n\u2022
        \u201CCollection of crypto wallets\u201D\\n\u2022 \u201CCollecting information
        about the system\u201D\\n\u2022 \u201CDecryption of logs on the server side\u201D\\n\\nThe
        file also includes instructions for setting up the XSSLite web panel and generating
        client-side payloads, which the developer states are coded using Python Flask
        and C#, respectively. The file also includes an explanation of how XSSLite
        client-side payloads collect and send cookie and password data. The developer
        states that a copy of all collected data is encoded in byte format in a JSON
        message and sent to the server, where the data is decrypted using AES.\\n\\nAdditionally,
        Instructions.txt included statements regarding CognitoInc\u2019s motivations
        for creating XSSLite malware, and their plans to develop a more fully-functional
        product in the future, which they intend to sell. Allegedly, CognitoInc initially
        designed XSSLite with RAT functionality and additional stealer functionalities
        that were removed from the source code, with CognitoInc stating \u201Cit would
        be too awkward to put such ready-made software in the public domain\u201D.\\n\\nInsikt

        March 14, 2024, internet service monitor NetBlocks reported major disruption
        to internet connections in at least sixteen Central and West African countries
        due to damage to at least four undersea cables &ndash;&ndash; West Africa
        Cable System (WACS), MainOne, SAT3, and Africa Coast to Europe (ACE). On March
        15, MainOne reported that the cable failure occurred due to a cut on one of
        its cable systems between Senegal and Ivory Coast, which \u201Cdisrupted MainOne
        services south of Senegal through to Nigeria\u201D and constituted a \u201Cforce
        majeure\u201D event. Damage to the cables is likely to substantially disrupt
        internet and mobile service, as well as services including social media, international
        bank transfers, and international voice calls. Alternative routes for internet
        traffic will likely restore connectivity in the near term. However, combined
        damage to multiple subsea cables between Africa and Europe, including damage
        to cables in the Red Sea reported in late February 2024, very likely raises
        the risk of future connectivity disruptions in the region.\\n\\nBenin, Ivory
        Coast, and Liberia have reportedly been most affected, with Burkina Faso,
        Cameroon, Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Lesotho, Mauritius, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria,
        Rwanda, South Africa, and Togo also reporting disruptions. On March 14, NetBlocks
        reported that internet connectivity in the Ivory Coast dropped to 4%, with
        connectivity also dropping to very low levels in Benin (14%), Liberia (17%),
        and Ghana (25%). On March 15, Nigeria\u2019s First City Monument Bank and
        Zenith Bank reported continuing disruptions for the second day to electronic
        transactions and mobile banking. In Liberia, social media services were unavailable
        across most of the country, and mobile payments were also reportedly affected.\\n\\nWhile
        repairs are underway, the combined impact of damage to subsea cables off West
        Africa and in the Red Sea will very likely increase the risk of severe connectivity
        disruptions in the event of further damage to regional subsea communications
        infrastructure. Previous damage to the West Africa Cable System and the South
        Atlantic 3 cable following an undersea landslide in 2023 took approximately
        one month to repair. Moreover, according to the International Cable Protection
        Committee, there are only approximately 60 ships worldwide capable of laying
        and maintaining cables, likely slowing efforts to repair damaged cables. Illustrating
        the combined impact of the damages to cables both in the Red Sea and off West
        Africa, MTN Group and Vodacom Group, the continent\u2019s largest wireless
        service carriers, reported that \u201Cmultiple undersea cable failures\u201D
        between Europe and Southern Africa were impacting network providers. Similarly,
        Microsoft reported disruptions to its cloud and Microsoft 365 applications
        in Africa, citing the impact of damage to the West African cables as well
        as those in the Red Sea. Microsoft\u2019s update on March 14, 2024, stated
        that \u201CThe combination of incidents has impacted all Africa capacity \u2013\u2013
        including other cloud providers and public internet\u201D.\\n\\nFor previous

        March 12, 2024, SonicWall Capture Labs reported that it observed a new variant
        of the StopCrypt (Djvu) ransomware in the wild, which utilizes multi-stage
        shellcodes to evade detection. StopCrpyt, dubbed as the most widely distributed
        malware, starts its attack chain by creating a string of msim32.dll on the
        stack and loading the DLL using LoadLibrary. It then executes a time-delaying
        loop to artificially prolong its execution time and evade detection. Next,
        the ransomware constructs API function calls by constructing function names
        or strings containing API names directly on the stack, instead of using straightforward
        API calls that can be easily identified. It then resolves the addresses of
        various APIs and performs process hollowing in the second stage of its payload.
        The final payload encrypts files and adds the .msjd extension.\\n\\nSonicWall

        March 15, 2024, Unit 42 reported an analysis on BunnyLoader 3.0, released
        on February 11, 2024, by \\\"PLAYER_BUNNY\\\". BunnyLoader malware operates
        as malware-as-a-service (MaaS) and is available on dark web forums. Player_Bunny
        advertised that the new version is \u201Ccompletely redesigned and enhanced
        by 90%,\u201D including improving the payload performance, reducing payload
        size, and advanced keylogging capabilities. Since the first version was released
        in September 2023, BunnyLoader has undergone rapid development to enhance
        its capabilities and evade detection. The loader is developed to steal information,
        credentials, cryptocurrency theft, and the capability to deploy further malicious
        payloads such as Denial-of-Service (DOS). BunnyLoader 3.0 payload is delivered
        by downloading an embedded dropper via a CMD file.\\n\\nUnit 42's report identifies
        BunnyLoader 3.0's evolution into a modular MaaS. The operator can choose to
        deploy the needed modules. The modular components include:\\n\\n- Keylogger
        Module: This module captures keystrokes and logs sensitive input data. It's
        developed to detect when users interact with particular applications or services,
        targeting those moments for data capture to maximize the theft of valuable
        information.\\n- Stealer Module: Operating autonomously, this module specializes
        in extracting a broad array of data, including credentials, from the compromised
        system. It communicates directly with the command-and-control (C2) server,
        uploading stolen data for the threat actors.\\n- Clipper Module: Focused on
        cryptocurrency theft, this module monitors the clipboard for cryptocurrency
        wallet addresses. Upon detection, it replaces the legitimate address with
        one controlled by the threat actors, redirecting funds to the threat actor's
        wallets.\\n- Denial of Service (DoS) Module: This module enables threat actors
        to disrupt services by overwhelming targets with traffic. Threat actors can
        overload services with excessive traffic and execute GET or POST HTTP flood
        attacks.\\n\\nFor further detection, the analyzed IOCs are available in this
        note, and the YARA detection rule is available in Unit 42's report.\",\"topic\":[{\"id\":\"TXSFt5\",\"name\":\"Validated

        March 12, 2024, IBM security researchers disclosed GhostRace (CVE-2024-2193),
        a vulnerability merging speculative execution with race conditions into Speculative
        Race Conditions (SRCs), allowing threat actors to sidestep synchronization
        methods like mutexes via branch misprediction attacks, thus facilitating unauthorized
        data leakage. The race conditions are anticipated to affect major hardware
        vendors (Intel, AMD, ARM, IBM) and the Linux kernel at the end of 2023. USENIX
        Security\u201924 research paper highlighted the challenge of addressing speculative
        execution combined with race conditions, the team prepares to share their
        insights, Proof Of Concept (POC), and mitigation techniques. At the time of
        writing, the vulnerability was not being exploited in the wild.\\n\\nOn March
        15, 2024, The Hacker News further detailed GhostRace, comparing it to the
        previously identified Spectre 1.0 (CVE-2017-5753) vulnerability. The report
        indicates that GhostRace enables threat actors to perform unauthorized data
        extraction from processors through Speculative Concurrent Use-After-Free (SCUAF)
        attacks. SRC operates on paths that the CPU inaccurately speculates on, similar
        to Spectre v1, but it specifically targets vulnerable code segments for information
        leakage.\\n\\nFollowing the disclosure of GhostRace, AMD indicated its existing
        Spectre-related security measures are effective for this new vulnerability.
        Meanwhile, Xen, an open-source hypervisor, implemented LOCK_HARDEN, a security
        enhancement for x86 architectures, aiming to defend vulnerabilities like GhostRace.\",\"topic\":[{\"id\":\"UrMRnT\",\"name\":\"Informational\",\"type\":\"Topic\",\"description\":\"Brief

        and edgeAggregator version 3.60, tracked as CVE-2023-38126 and CVE-2024-0860.
        CISA recommended organizations to update affected devices to version 3.70
        or greater to address the vulnerabilities. Neither of the two vulnerabilities
        have been exploited in the wild at the time of writing. \\n\\nDetails surrounding
        the two vulnerabilities are as follows:\\n\\n-CVE-2023-38126: a path traversal

        of a user-supplied path before incorporating it into file operations. CVE-2023-38126
        requires that threat actors acquire administrative privileges to modify files
        within the filesystem. Successful exploitation can allow threat actors to
        execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data compromise,
        or system manipulation.\\n\\n-CVE-2024-0860: a cleartext transmission of sensitive
        information flaw with a severity rating of 8.0. If exploited,  threat actors
