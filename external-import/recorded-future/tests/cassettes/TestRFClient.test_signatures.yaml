        March 15, 2024, Unit 42 reported an analysis on BunnyLoader 3.0, released
        on February 11, 2024, by \\\"PLAYER_BUNNY\\\". BunnyLoader malware operates
        as malware-as-a-service (MaaS) and is available on dark web forums. Player_Bunny
        advertised that the new version is \u201Ccompletely redesigned and enhanced
        by 90%,\u201D including improving the payload performance, reducing payload
        size, and advanced keylogging capabilities. Since the first version was released
        in September 2023, BunnyLoader has undergone rapid development to enhance
        its capabilities and evade detection. The loader is developed to steal information,
        credentials, cryptocurrency theft, and the capability to deploy further malicious
        payloads such as Denial-of-Service (DOS). BunnyLoader 3.0 payload is delivered
        by downloading an embedded dropper via a CMD file.\\n\\nUnit 42's report identifies
        BunnyLoader 3.0's evolution into a modular MaaS. The operator can choose to
        deploy the needed modules. The modular components include:\\n\\n- Keylogger
        Module: This module captures keystrokes and logs sensitive input data. It's
        developed to detect when users interact with particular applications or services,
        targeting those moments for data capture to maximize the theft of valuable
        information.\\n- Stealer Module: Operating autonomously, this module specializes
        in extracting a broad array of data, including credentials, from the compromised
        system. It communicates directly with the command-and-control (C2) server,
        uploading stolen data for the threat actors.\\n- Clipper Module: Focused on
        cryptocurrency theft, this module monitors the clipboard for cryptocurrency
        wallet addresses. Upon detection, it replaces the legitimate address with
        one controlled by the threat actors, redirecting funds to the threat actor's
        wallets.\\n- Denial of Service (DoS) Module: This module enables threat actors
        to disrupt services by overwhelming targets with traffic. Threat actors can
        overload services with excessive traffic and execute GET or POST HTTP flood
        attacks.\\n\\nFor further detection, the analyzed IOCs are available in this
        note, and the YARA detection rule is available in Unit 42's report.\",\"topic\":[{\"id\":\"TXSFt5\",\"name\":\"Validated

        March 12, 2024, IBM security researchers disclosed GhostRace (CVE-2024-2193),
        a vulnerability merging speculative execution with race conditions into Speculative
        Race Conditions (SRCs), allowing threat actors to sidestep synchronization
        methods like mutexes via branch misprediction attacks, thus facilitating unauthorized
        data leakage. The race conditions are anticipated to affect major hardware
        vendors (Intel, AMD, ARM, IBM) and the Linux kernel at the end of 2023. USENIX
        Security\u201924 research paper highlighted the challenge of addressing speculative
        execution combined with race conditions, the team prepares to share their
        insights, Proof Of Concept (POC), and mitigation techniques. At the time of
        writing, the vulnerability was not being exploited in the wild.\\n\\nOn March
        15, 2024, The Hacker News further detailed GhostRace, comparing it to the
        previously identified Spectre 1.0 (CVE-2017-5753) vulnerability. The report
        indicates that GhostRace enables threat actors to perform unauthorized data
        extraction from processors through Speculative Concurrent Use-After-Free (SCUAF)
        attacks. SRC operates on paths that the CPU inaccurately speculates on, similar
        to Spectre v1, but it specifically targets vulnerable code segments for information
        leakage.\\n\\nFollowing the disclosure of GhostRace, AMD indicated its existing
        Spectre-related security measures are effective for this new vulnerability.
        Meanwhile, Xen, an open-source hypervisor, implemented LOCK_HARDEN, a security
        enhancement for x86 architectures, aiming to defend vulnerabilities like GhostRace.\",\"topic\":[{\"id\":\"UrMRnT\",\"name\":\"Informational\",\"type\":\"Topic\",\"description\":\"Brief

        March 13, 2024, Wordfence disclosed critical and high-severity vulnerabilities
        in widely used WordPress plugins. CVE-2024-2172, a critical vulnerability
        residing in miniOrange's Malware Scanner and Web Application Firewall plugins,
        enables unauthenticated threat actors to escalate privileges to administrator
        access due to a missing capability check on the mo_wpns_init() function. This
        allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate their privileges to an administrator.
        The vulnerability affects over 10,300 WordPress installations collectively.
        Both plugins have been permanently closed without patches, necessitating immediate
        removal.\\n\\nConcurrently, CVE-2024-1991, a high-severity vulnerability in
        the RegistrationMagic plugin, allows authenticated threat actors to arbitrarily
        elevate their privileges due to the insecure implementation of an update_users_role()
        function. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could enable threat
        actors to alter site content and user permissions to grant administrator privileges.
        This vulnerability affects over 10,000 sites but has been addressed in RegistrationMagic
        version 5.3.1.0.\\n\\nAt the time of writing, there are no confirmed instances
        of exploitation in the wild for the mentioned vulnerabilities.\",\"topic\":[{\"id\":\"TXSFt5\",\"name\":\"Validated

        March 14, 2024, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
        disclosed two critical vulnerabilities affecting Softing AG's edgeConnector
        and edgeAggregator version 3.60, tracked as CVE-2023-38126 and CVE-2024-0860.
        CISA recommended organizations to update affected devices to version 3.70
        or greater to address the vulnerabilities. Neither of the two vulnerabilities
        have been exploited in the wild at the time of writing. \\n\\nDetails surrounding
        the two vulnerabilities are as follows:\\n\\n-CVE-2023-38126: a path traversal
        flaw with a severity rating of 7.2 that stems from the absence of proper validation
        of a user-supplied path before incorporating it into file operations. CVE-2023-38126
        requires that threat actors acquire administrative privileges to modify files
        within the filesystem. Successful exploitation can allow threat actors to
        execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data compromise,
        or system manipulation.\\n\\n-CVE-2024-0860: a cleartext transmission of sensitive
        information flaw with a severity rating of 8.0. If exploited,  threat actors
        cam intercept packets and manipulate requests, potentially leading to unauthorized
        access to sensitive information like user data.\\n\",\"topic\":[{\"id\":\"TXSFt5\",\"name\":\"Validated
