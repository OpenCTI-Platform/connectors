  "description": "The OpenCTI Stixify Connector bridges the gap between unstructured open-source reporting and operational threat intelligence by seamlessly ingesting intelligence derived from threat reports into OpenCTI.\n\nPowered by Stixify, the connector processes intelligence derived from PDFs, advisories, research papers, and other document formats stored in Stixify Dossiers, converting narrative reporting into STIX-compliant objects such as indicators, attack patterns, campaigns, malware, vulnerabilities, and relationships.\n\n Built for both historical ingestion and continuous updates, the connector supports importing intelligence from one or multiple dossiers and keeps OpenCTI up to date through scheduled polling. STIX objects are seamlessly integrated into OpenCTI, where they become searchable, correlated, and actionable alongside existing intelligence, making it a powerful solution for transforming document-centric reporting into operational CTI.",
