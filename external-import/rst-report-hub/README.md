# RST Report Hub Connector for OpenCTI by RST Cloud

The **RST Report Hub Connector** integrates various APT reports from security companies, research groups, cyber communities, and individuals into OpenCTI. RST Cloud manages the conversion of human-readable reports into STIX bundles. This connector retrieves data from RST Cloud, importing the PDF version of each report along with a corresponding summary, key ideas, and facts into OpenCTI. It also includes extracted objects and relationships between them, such as Intrusion Sets (threat actors), campaigns, malware, TTPs, tools, geographic data, sectors, CVEs, indicators, and other relevant objects. This integration enhances the capabilities of OpenCTI by providing valuable threat intelligence data, enabling CTI analysts to streamline APT report processing through automation via the [RST Report Hub](https://www.rstcloud.com/rst-report-hub/) integration, ultimately saving time.

## Key Features:

- **Brilliant Time Saver**: Manual import of threat reports is a time consuming activity that does not need to happen anymore.
- **Threat Report Library**: Keep all APT reports and their metadata, extracted objects in one place. 
- **OpenCTI Integration**: Seamlessly integrates the fetched data into OpenCTI's database.

This connector provides users with an enhanced and comprehensive understanding of the cybersecurity threat landscape by leveraging the detailed threat intelligence provided by RST Cloud.

## Requirements:
- OpenCTI Platform version 5.10.x or higher.
- An API Key for accessing RST Cloud.

## Recommended connectors

## Configuration:

Configuration of the connector is straightforward. The minimal configuration requires you just enter the RST Cloud API key to be provided and OpenCTI connection settings specified. Below is the full list of parameters you can set:

| Parameter | Docker envvar | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenCTI URL | `OPENCTI_URL` | Yes | The URL of the OpenCTI platform. |
| OpenCTI Token | `OPENCTI_TOKEN` | Yes | The default admin token set in the OpenCTI platform. |
| Connector ID | `CONNECTOR_ID` | Yes | A unique `UUIDv4` identifier for this connector instance. |
| Connector Type | `CONNECTOR_TYPE` | Yes | Should always be set to `EXTERNAL_IMPORT` for this connector. |
| Connector Name | `CONNECTOR_NAME` | Yes | Name of the connector. For example: `RST Report Hub`. |
| Connector Scope | `CONNECTOR_SCOPE` | Yes | The scope or type of data the connector is importing, either a MIME type or Stix Object. E.g. application/json |
| Confidence Level | `CONNECTOR_CONFIDENCE_LEVEL` | Yes | The default confidence level for created sightings. It's a number between 1 and 100, with 100 being the most confident. |
| Log Level | `CONNECTOR_LOG_LEVEL` | Yes | Determines the verbosity of the logs. Options are `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error`. |
| Run and Terminate | `CONNECTOR_RUN_AND_TERMINATE` | Yes | If set to true, the connector will terminate after a successful run. Useful for debugging or one-time runs. |
| Update Existing Data | `CONFIG_UPDATE_EXISTING_DATA` | Yes | Decide whether the connector should update already existing data in the database. |
| Interval | `CONFIG_INTERVAL` | Yes | Determines how often the connector will run, set in hours. |
| RST Report Hub API Key | `RST_REPORT_HUB_API_KEY` | Yes | Your API Key for accessing RST Cloud. |
| RST Report Hub Base URL | `RST_REPORT_HUB_BASE_URL` | No | By default, use https://api.rstcloud.net/v1/. In some cases, you may want to use a local API endpoint |
| RST Report Hub Connection Timeout | `RST_REPORT_HUB_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` | No | Connection timeout to the API. Default (sec): `30` |
| RST Report Hub Read Timeout | `RST_REPORT_HUB_READ_TIMEOUT` | No | Read timeout for each feed. If the connector is unable to fetch a report in time, increase the read timeout. Default (sec): `60` |
| RST Report Hub Read Timeout | `RST_REPORT_HUB_RETRY_DELAY` | No | Specifies how long to wait in seconds before next attempt to connect to the API. Default (sec): `30` |
| RST Report Hub Download Retry Count | `RST_REPORT_HUB_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` | No | Default (attempts): `5` |
