# OpenCTI Sentinel Incidents Connector

This connector is deprecated. A mistake has been made as this connector actually pulls incident from Defender and not Sentinel.

Please use:

* [Microsoft Defender Incidents connector](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/connectors/tree/master/external-import/microsoft-defender-incidents) (for getting Defender incidents & alerts)
* [Microsoft Sentinel Incidents connector](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/connectors/tree/master/external-import/microsoft-sentinel-incidents) (for getting Sentinel incidents & alerts)

This connector will be removed in OpenCTI 6.6.0.
