Alternatively, the website may have been legitimately moved to a new hosting provider, a CDN (Content Distribution Network) may host company's website on a new location, or the domain has expired.",

If the IP addresses are unfamiliar, we recommend checking whether the domain has expired.<br>If the domain is still owned by company, but it is pointing to an unfamiliar IP address, we recommend investigating the site now pointed to by the domain to determine the nature and severity of the threat.

However, it is important to note that the employees who use these addresses are more susceptible to receiving threats via E-mail.",

If you need to access the URLs below, we recommend doing so from a secure device that is not connected to the rest of the organization. Access the URLs at your own risk.</strong><br>%elements%",
            "recommendation": "As the above E-mail addresses are discoverable to attackers who are performing reconnaissance on company, and as some reconnaissance tools are known to look for corporate E-mails using the same techniques we have used to extract the addresses above, the employees using these E-mail addresses should be considered at a higher risk of receiving E-mail threats. We recommend ensuring that the employees recently underwent cyber risk awareness training and that they are familiar with potential cyber threats.<br><br>If you prefer the E-mail addresses above would not be discoverable to threat actors, consider reaching out to the website owners.",
