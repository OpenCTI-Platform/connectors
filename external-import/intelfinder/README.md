# Internal Enrichment Intelfinder Connector

This connector is designed for integration with the OpenCTI platform and [Intelfinder](https://intelfinder.io/). The integration imports Intelfinder alerts and converts them into OpenCTI incidents. Applicable `elements` are transformed into their related Stix objects and linked to the parent incident. 

## Installation

### Requirements

- OpenCTI Platform >= 5.12.17
- Intelfinder Subscription and [API Token](https://dash.intelfinder.io/integrations.php?i=api)
- Intelfinder API enabled

### Configuration

Configuration parameters are provided using environment variables. Some of them are placed directly in the `docker-compose.yml` since they are not expected to be modified by final users once defined by the developer of the connector.

#### Docker Environment Variables (Set in `docker-compose.yml`)

| Docker envvar             | Mandatory | Description                            |
| ------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------- |

| `CONNECTOR_ID`                      | Yes       | A unique `UUIDv4` for this connector.                                   |
| `CONNECTOR_CONFIDENCE_LEVEL`        | Yes       | Default confidence level for created sightings (0 to 100).              |
| `CONNECTOR_LOG_LEVEL`               | Yes       | Log level (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`).                           |
| `CONNECTOR_RUN_EVERY`               | Yes       | Frequency of connector execution. The time unit is represented by a single character at the end of the string: d for days, h for hours, m for minutes, and s for seconds. e.g., `30s` is 30 seconds. `1d` is 1 day.         |
| `CONNECTOR_UPDATE_EXISTING_DATA`    | Yes       | Whether to update existing data (e.g., `true` or `false`).              |
| `INTELFINDER_TOKEN`                 | Yes       | Token for Intelfinder access.                                           |

| `INTELFINDER_SEED_ALERT_ID`         | No        | Intelfinder Seed Alert ID, Provide initial Alert ID to start import from (e.g., `64d02b1e8592e8209a077bf2`)            |

### Supported Stix2 Objects

- `URL`, `DomainName`, `IPv4Address`, `IPv6Address`, `Note`, `UserAccount`

### Supported OpenCTI Custom Objects

- `CustomObjectCaseIncident`, `CustomObjectTask`

## Additional Details
Intelfinder occassionaly will create a large content payload. The code supports logic to TRUNCATE the payload in the event it is larger than 80% of the RabbitMQ Default maximum. The following message will be in place where content is TRUNCATED: `TRUNCATED DUE TO SIZE LIMIT, CHECK INTELFINDER FOR FULL CONTENT.`. While the RabbitMQ maximum can be adjusted, there are other dependencies for OpenCTI and STIX objects that have a maximum content size, therefore, this connector is set to the lowest ceiling to limit complications.
