The connector uses [C2-Tracker](https://github.com/montysecurity/C2-Tracker) from montysecurity to import the latest IOCs.

The intel feed collects IOCs weekly and it tracks various C2s, malware, botnets, etc. If the OpenCTI instance also has the [MITRE Connector](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/connectors/tree/master/external-import/mitre) installed, the C2-Tracker connector will map IOCs to tools/malware from MITRE where applicable.

The connector will automatically deleted old IOCs as they age out of the IOC feed.
