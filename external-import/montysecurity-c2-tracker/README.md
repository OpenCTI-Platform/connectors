## Introduction
The MontySecurity C2-Tracker connector imports a free, community-driven IOC feed into OpenCTI, creating Malware and 
associated IP addresses. The feed leverages Shodan searches to identify active C2, botnet, and malware infrastructure 
across the internet.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python >= 3.11
- OpenCTI Platform >= 6.8.13
- [`pycti`](https://pypi.org/project/pycti/) library matching your OpenCTI version
- [`connectors-sdk`](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/connectors.git@master#subdirectory=connectors-sdk) library matching your OpenCTI version

## Configuration variables

Find all the configuration variables available here: [Connector Configurations](./__metadata__/CONNECTOR_CONFIG_DOC.md)

_The `opencti` and `connector` options in the `docker-compose.yml` and `config.yml` are the same as for any other connector.
For more information regarding these variables, please refer to [OpenCTI's documentation on connectors](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/deployment/connectors/)._

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

Before building the Docker container, you need to set the version of pycti in `requirements.txt` equal to whatever
version of OpenCTI you're running. Example, `pycti==5.12.20`. If you don't, it will take the latest version, but
sometimes the OpenCTI SDK fails to initialize.

Build a Docker Image using the provided `Dockerfile`.

Example:

```shell
# Replace the IMAGE NAME with the appropriate value
docker build . -t [IMAGE NAME]:latest
```

Make sure to replace the environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` with the appropriate configurations for your
environment. Then, start the docker container with the provided docker-compose.yml

```shell
docker compose up -d
# -d for detached
```

### Manual Deployment

Create a file `config.yml` based on the provided `config.yml.sample`.

Replace the configuration variables (especially the "**ChangeMe**" variables) with the appropriate configurations for
you environment.

Install the required python dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment):

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, start the connector from `src` directory:

```shell
python3 main.py
```

## Usage

After Installation, the connector should require minimal interaction to use, and should update automatically at a regular interval specified in your `docker-compose.yml` or `config.yml` in `duration_period`.

However, if you would like to force an immediate download of a new batch of entities, navigate to:

`Data management` -> `Ingestion` -> `Connectors` in the OpenCTI platform.

Find the connector, and click on the refresh button to reset the connector's state and force a new
download of data by re-running the connector.

## Behavior

At each run, the connector fetches the malware list from the Monty Security C2-Tracker
dataset, then downloads associated IP lists for each malware family. It converts
malware names and IP observables into STIX objects and creates `indicates`
relationships between each IP and its malware.

The generated bundle is sent to OpenCTI as a scheduled external import. The
connector also stores `last_run` in state so operators can track previous
executions in logs.

Because the source is community OSINT, entities are marked with a configurable
TLP level (default: `clear`) and attributed to the Monty Security author identity.

## Debugging

The connector can be debugged by setting the appropiate log level.
Note that logging messages can be added using `self.helper.connector_logger,{LOG_LEVEL}("Sample message")`, i.
e., `self.helper.connector_logger.error("An error message")`.
