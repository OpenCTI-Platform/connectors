# Google Threat Intelligence Connector

---

## Introduction

Google Threat Intelligence Feeds Connector ingests threat intelligence from the Google Threat Intel API and feeds it into the OpenCTI solution, focusing -for now- on STIX entities tied to report objects.
It extracts and transforms relevant data types report, location, sector, malware, intrusion-set, attack-pattern, vulnerability, and raw IOCs delivering structured, and ingest that in an intelligible way into OpenCTI.

Most of the data is extracted from the reports, but some entities are extracted from the report's relationships.
More information can be found in the [Google Threat Intel API documentation](https://gtidocs.virustotal.com/reference/reports).

> This connector requires a Google Threat Intel API key to function. You can obtain one by signing up for the Google Threat Intel service.5
> Reports Analysis are only available to users with the Google Threat Intelligence (Google TI) Enterprise or Enterprise Plus licenses.5

## Quick start

Hereâ€™s a high-level overview to get the connector up and running:

1. **Set environment variables**:
        - inside `docker-compose.yml`
2. **Pull and run the connector** using Docker:
```bash
        docker compose up -d
```

### Running the Connector Locally

The connector is designed to be run in a Docker container. However, if you want to run it locally for development purposes, you can do so by following these steps:

1/ Clone the connector's repository:
```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
```

2/ Navigate to the connector directory
```bash
    cd external-import/google-ti-feeds
```

3/ Ensure you are using a Python 3.12 version

4/ Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .[all]
```
(for legacy purposes, you can also use `pip install -r requirements.txt` that is in editable mode.)

5a/ Set the required variables:
In your shell:
```bash
        export OPENCTI_URL=<your_opencti_url>
        ...
```
OR sourcing a `.env` file:
```bash
        source .env
```
OR creating a "config.yml" file at the root of the project:
```yaml
       opencti:
           url: <your_opencti_url>
       ...
```

6/ Run the connector:
```bash
       GoogleTIFeeds
```
  or ignore 5b and run it with the environment variable:
```bash
      GoogleTIFeeds
```
 or by launching the main.py:
```bash
      python connector/__main__.py
```
 or by launching the module:
```bash
      python -m connector
```

Note: Your commits must be signed using a GPG key. Otherwise, your Pull Request will be rejected.

### Linting and formatting

Added to the connectors linteing and formatting rules, this connector is developed and checked using ruff and mypy to ensure the code is type-checked and linted.
The dedicated configurations are set in the `pyproject.toml` file.
You can run the following commands to check the code:

```bash
   python -m isort .
   python -m black . --check
   python -m ruff check .
   python -m mypy .
   python -m pip_audit .
```

### Testing

To run the tests, you can use the following command:
```bash
    python -m pytest -svv
```
