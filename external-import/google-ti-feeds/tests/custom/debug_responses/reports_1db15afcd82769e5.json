          "content": "<p>Hunt3rKill3rs is a hacktivist threat group actively targeting and compromising internet-accessible operational technology (OT) devices across various industries and countries. They gain unauthorized access to OT devices directly via the browser (HTTP) and/or through remote services, likely by exploiting weak or default credentials. With this access they alter device configurations, including changing passwords, creating new users, and manipulating human-machine interface (HMI) controls. They also deface compromised devices by changing text fields and creating users with their group's name or political messaging. Their operations span multiple countries, including European nations, Israel, and the United States. We assess this group poses a moderate risk to OT assets due to their explicit targeting of OT and limited capabilities that we have so far seen demonstrated against what are probably improperly secured and internet-accessible OT assets.</p><p></p><ul><li><p>We have observed Hunt3rKill3rs' claims of accessing and manipulating OT assets since mid-2024. To date, their claims are normally posted to their Telegram channel (https://t.me/Hunt3rkill3rs1) and include politically motivated messaging and screenshots showing a threat actor interacting with HMIs, programmable logic controllers (PLC), IP cameras, and a variety of other internet-exposed devices. The posts often contain a mixture of both Russian and English language.</p></li><li><p>The interactions with the devices are frequently haphazard; the operator appears to be discovering the control panel in real time as they make mistakes changing settings and click buttons just to change the state of various components. The screenshots included in their posts often include configuration details and defacement.</p></li><li><p>Hunt3rKill3rs has conducted this type of operation against water and wastewater systems, building automation, and a variety of miscellaneous ICS/OT oriented devices. The group has unlikely achieved impactful real-world effects, and their claims are often overstated.</p></li></ul><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://api.intelligence.mandiant.com/v4/reports/assets/a1-4388a88f5f787f4f1d1e2ec8fc0db9885f6d0b74.png?reportId=24-10020775&amp;version=1.0\" width=\"624\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1: Hunt3rKill3rs' OT risk level</p><p></p><p><strong>OT Threat Activity</strong></p><p></p><p>We track and assess threat activity impacting OT environments to determine the actor's motivation and capacity to impact control systems and physical processes.

The actor shared a number of screenshots displaying Moxa EtherDevice Switch series EDS-518E and system configuration details. The actor is likely creating an EtherDevice switch under the name of Hunt3rKill3rs in the system and also shared additional screenshots of operation modes and network settings. The actor included a list of devices accessed along with credentials created on the system.

The actor shared multiple screenshots from the victims' devices. Visible names include Anderson StormWater Treatment, Municipality of Saint-Fabien-De-Panet, Lake Down Sub-Basin, and Apex Energies. Devices include an Unitronics V570 HMI, likely a smart meter, a Turck Cloud Portal display, and various unidentifiable devices. The actor also included images detailing configuration changes and defacements in text fields.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td><p>5/23/2024</p></td>\n<td><p>Hunt3rKill3rs claim to have accessed and manipulated a Siemens PLC product, SIMATIC S7 CP. Additionally, the actors posted screenshots of devices accessed, including but not limited to: Siemens SIMATIC S7 CP, Cisco SPA504G, and 750-880 WAGO PLC. In a separate post the group claims access to Unitronics PLCs and shares a number of screenshots showing PLC data and images containing French language. One of the images again shows \"lavagepro.com,\" which was previously referenced within another claim in May 15, 2024, by the group. We suspect the actor is scanning for internet-accessible OT with remote services enabled.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td><p>5/15/2024</p></td>\n<td><p>Hunt3rKill3rs claims to have accessed and manipulated multiple internet-accessible OT devices in Europe and Israel.
