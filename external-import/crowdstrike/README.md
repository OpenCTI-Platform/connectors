# OpenCTI CrowdStrike Connector

The OpenCTI CrowdStrike connector can be used to import knowledge from the CrowdStrike
Falcon platform. The connector leverages the Intel APIs to get information about
CrowdStrikeâ€™s intelligence, including data about actors, indicators, reports, and YARA
rules.

**Note**: Requires subscription to the CrowdStrike Falcon platform. The subscription
details dictate what data is actually available to the connector.

## Installation

The OpenCTI CrowdStrike connector is a standalone Python process that must have access
to the OpenCTI platform and the RabbitMQ. RabbitMQ credentials and connection parameters
are provided by the API directly, as configured in the platform settings.

Enabling this connector could be done by launching the Python process directly after
providing the correct configuration in the `config.yml` file or within a Docker with
the image `opencti/connector-crowdstrike:latest`. We provide an example of
[`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) file that could be used independently or
integrated to the global `docker-compose.yml` file of OpenCTI.

If you are using it independently, remember that the connector will try to connect to
the RabbitMQ on the port configured in the OpenCTI platform.

## Known Issues and Workarounds for Crowdstrike Connector Scopes

### Issue

The Crowdstrike connector offers multiple scopes for data ingestion: 
- **actor**
- **report**
- **indicator**
- **yara_master**

When the `yara_master` scope is enabled simultaneously with other scopes (i.e., `actor`, `report`, and `indicator`), ingestion speed can significantly slow down. Additionally, due to the large volume of data (about 13GB) in `yara_master` and lack of pagination, the connector state may not update accurately.

### Root Cause
The `yara_master` scope imports a high volume of data. Since pagination is not available, this overwhelms the connector when combined with other scopes, leading to:
- Slow ingestion performance.
- Incomplete or inaccurate updates to the connector state.

### Workaround
To address this issue, set up two separate Crowdstrike connectors, each dedicated to specific scopes:

1. **Primary Connector**:
   - Scopes: `actor`, `report`, and `indicator`
   - This connector will handle the main threat intelligence data without `yara_master` data, ensuring timely ingestion and accurate updates.

2. **Secondary Connector**:
   - Scope: `yara_master` only
   - This connector will handle `yara_master` data independently, which allows it to manage the high data volume without interfering with the ingestion of other scope data.

### Summary

By isolating the `yara_master` scope in a dedicated connector, you avoid slow ingestion rates and inaccurate state updates, ensuring efficient and stable data processing across all scopes.
