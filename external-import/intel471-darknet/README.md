# connector-intel471-darknet

This connector imports alerts from Intel471's Dark Web database into OpenCTI. The alerts are generated by filters that has been previously configured on the Mandiant user interface. For each alert, an "Incident" entity is created in the OpenCTI platform. This entity references the identifier of the original alert and that of the filter that generated it. Depending on the content of the alert, other entities are created in the platform and linked to it within the knowledge base. For example: a report, observables, media content, forum posts, threat actors.

The imported data consists of STIX2 entities from the following categories:
- incidents,
- observables,
- actors,
- organizations,
- individuals,
- sectors,
- localisations,
- malwares,
- media content,
- media channels,
- vulnerabilities,
- reports,
- relationships.


## Installation

### Requirements

- OpenCTI Platform >= 6.4.3

### Configuration

Configuration parameters are provided using environment variables as described below.
Some of them are placed directly in the `docker-compose.yml` since they are not expected to be modified by final users once that they have been defined by the developer of the connector.

Note that the values that follow can be grabbed within Python code using `self.helper.{PARAMETER}`, i. e., `self.helper.connector_nane`.

Expected environment variables to be set in the  `docker-compose.yml` that describe the connector itself.
Most of the times, these values are NOT expected to be changed.

| Parameter                            | Docker envvar                       | Mandatory    | Description                                                                                                                                                |

However, there are other values which are expected to be configured by end users.
The following values are expected to be defined in the `.env` file.
This file is included in the `.gitignore` to avoid leaking sensitive date). 
Note tha the `.env.sample` file can be used as a reference.

The ones that follow are connector's generic execution parameters expected to be added for export connectors.
