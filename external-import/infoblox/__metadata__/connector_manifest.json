This connector specifically imports key threat indicators, including URLs, Domain Names, and IPv4 addresses, along with corresponding observables such as URLs, Domain Names, and IPv4 entities. Additionally, it creates an organizational entity for Infoblox, allowing for a structured and organized display of the imported data within OpenCTI.",
