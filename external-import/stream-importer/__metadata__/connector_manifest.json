  "description": "This connector fetches events stored in minio and sends them to RabbitMQ to be ingested by OpenCTI. The files containing the events must have been generated by the stream-exporter connector. This is used when wanting to replicate an OpenCTI instance with another one when the two instances cannot be connected to each other. The user that runs the stream-importer connector will be set as the creator of the objects.\nThe state of the connector contains the file count of the last ingested file and the order is checked before importing a file.\nWhen an event file is processed, it is moved to another bucket.",
