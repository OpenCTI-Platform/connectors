# OpenCTI Urlscan.io Connector

## Installation

The Urlscan connector is a standalone Python process that must have access to the OpenCTI platform and the RabbitMQ server.
RabbitMQ credentials and connection parameters are provided by the API directly, as configured in the platform settings.

Enabling this connector could be done by launching the Python process directly after providing the correct configuration in the `config.yml` file or within a Docker with the image `opencti/connector-urlscan:latest`.
We provide an example of [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) file that could be used independently or integrated to the global `docker-compose.yml` file of OpenCTI.

If you are using it independently, remember that the connector will try to connect to the RabbitMQ on the port configured in the OpenCTI platform.
