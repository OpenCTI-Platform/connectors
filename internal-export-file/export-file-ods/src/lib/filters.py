"""Filter-composition helpers for the ``export-file-ods`` connector.

This module is intentionally dependency-free (no ``unogenerator`` / no
``pycti``) so the filter combinators that enforce marking restrictions on
``full`` and ``query`` exports can be unit-tested without LibreOffice being
available on the CI runner.

Three public helpers are exposed:

* :func:`access_filter_has_content` — single source of truth for
  deciding whether a request's ``access_filter`` carries any usable
  content. Re-used by both combinators below **and** by the connector
  worker when it normalises ``access_filter`` for the per-direction
  relationship-list call, so the "no-op filter" check cannot diverge
  between neighbour discovery and neighbour fetch.
* :func:`build_neighbor_filter` — combines a positive ``ids`` filter for
  the neighbour candidates with the request's optional ``access_filter``.
* :func:`build_query_filter` — combines the user-supplied list filter for a
  ``query`` export with the request's optional ``access_filter``.

All three treat ``access_filter`` as optional: when ``filters`` and
``filterGroups`` are both empty or missing the filter is considered absent
and the user filter is returned as-is (or, for the neighbour case, only the
``ids`` group is returned). This mirrors the behaviour of every other
internal-export connector in the repository.

    An ``access_filter`` whose ``filters`` and ``filterGroups`` lists are
    both missing/empty is treated as absent — passing it to the platform

    This is the single source of truth for the "usable access filter"
    check across the connector: both the filter combinators below and
    the worker's per-direction relationship-list call rely on it, so the
    neighbour-discovery and neighbour-fetch stages cannot diverge.
