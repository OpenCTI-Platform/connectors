=====================

This is an `OASIS TC Open Repository
<https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/>`__. See the
`Governance <#governance>`__ section for more information.

The STIX 2 Pattern Validator is a software tool for checking the syntax of the
Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) STIX Pattern expressions, which are used within
STIX to express conditions (prepresented with the Cyber Observable data model)
that indicate particular cyber threat activity. The repository contains source
code, an ANTLR grammar, automated tests and associated documentation for the
tool. The validator can be used as a command-line tool or as a Python library
which can be included in other applications.

Quickstart
----------

1. Install with pip:

   .. code-block:: bash

        $ pip install stix2-patterns

2. Validate a pattern from the command line:

   .. code-block:: bash

        $ validate-patterns
        Enter a pattern to validate: [file-object:hashes.md5 = '79054025255fb1a26e4bc422aef54eb4']
        PASS: [file-object:hashes.md5 = '79054025255fb1a26e4bc422aef54eb4']

3. Validate a pattern from Python code:

   .. code:: python

        from stix2patterns.validator import run_validator

        pattern = "[file-object:hashes.md5 = '79054025255fb1a26e4bc422aef54eb4']"
        errors = run_validator(pattern)
