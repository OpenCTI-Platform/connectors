# OpenCTI Tanium Connector

This connector allows organizations to feed the **Tanium Intels** using OpenCTI knowledge.

This connector leverages the OpenCTI *events stream*, so it consumes knowledge in real time and, depending on its settings, create detection and hunting intel pieces in the Tanium platform.

## General overview

OpenCTI data is coming from *import* connectors. Once this data is ingested in OpenCTI, it is pushed to a Redis event stream. This stream is consumed by the Tanium connector to insert intel in the Tanium platform.
