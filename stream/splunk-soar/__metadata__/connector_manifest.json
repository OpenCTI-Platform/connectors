  "description": "The Splunk SOAR connector enables real-time streaming of OpenCTI incidents and containers to Splunk SOAR (formerly Phantom). It automatically converts OpenCTI incidents into SOAR events, and transforms OpenCTI containers (reports, groupings, cases) into SOAR cases with full entity resolution. The connector maps threat intelligence entities, observables, and indicators to SOAR artifacts, enabling seamless integration between threat intelligence management in OpenCTI and security orchestration, automation and response workflows in Splunk SOAR.",
