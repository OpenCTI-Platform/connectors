# OpenCTI CrowdStrike Connector

The OpenCTI CrowdStrike connector can be used to import knowledge from the CrowdStrike
Falcon platform. The connector leverages the Intel APIs to get information about
CrowdStrikeâ€™s intelligence, including data about actors, indicators, reports, and YARA
rules.

**Note**: Requires subscription to the CrowdStrike Falcon platform. The subscription
details dictate what data is actually available to the connector.

## Installation

The OpenCTI CrowdStrike connector is a standalone Python process that must have access
to the OpenCTI platform and the RabbitMQ. RabbitMQ credentials and connection parameters
are provided by the API directly, as configured in the platform settings.

Enabling this connector could be done by launching the Python process directly after
providing the correct configuration in the `config.yml` file or within a Docker with
the image `opencti/connector-crowdstrike:latest`. We provide an example of
[`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) file that could be used independently or
integrated to the global `docker-compose.yml` file of OpenCTI.

If you are using it independently, remember that the connector will try to connect to
the RabbitMQ on the port configured in the OpenCTI platform.

## Configuration

The connector can be configured with the following variables:

**Note**: It is not recommended to use the default value `0` for configuration parameters `report_start_timestamp` and `indicator_start_timestamp` because of the large data volumes.
