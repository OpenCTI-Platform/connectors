# OpenCTI Tanium Connector

This connector allows organizations to feed the **Tanium platform** using OpenCTI knowledge. 

This connector leverages the OpenCTI *events stream*, so it consumes knowledge in real time and, depending on its settings, create detection and hunting intel pieces in the Tanium platform.

## General overview

OpenCTI data is coming from *import* connectors. Once this data is ingested in OpenCTI, it is pushed to a Redis event stream. This stream is consumed by the Tanium connector to insert intel in the Tanium platform.

## Launch the connector and test it

After launching the connector, you should be able to see a new Intel source within the Tanium platform:

![New source](doc/source.png "New source")

Then just add the proper label to an indicator (`tanium_import_label`) or to a file observables (`tanium_reputation_blacklist_label`).
